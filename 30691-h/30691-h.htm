<i>Sir Basil showed his teeth in his ugly smile. &ldquo;A creator is never merciful.&rdquo;</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> two <i>batalões</i> turned from
the open waters of the lower
Tapajos River into the <i>igarapé</i>,
the lily-smothered shallows that
often mark an Indian
settlement
in the jungles of
Brazil. One of the two half-breed
rubber-gatherers suddenly stopped his
<i>batalõe</i> by thrusting a paddle against a
giant clump of lilies. In a corruption
of the Tupi dialect, he called over to
the white man occupying the other
frail craft.</p>
<p class='sidebarright'>Fate&rsquo;s retribution was adequate. There
emerged a rat with a man&rsquo;s head and face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We dare go no farther, master. The
country of the Ungapuks is bewitched.
It is too dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fearfully he
stared over his
shoulder toward a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
spot in the slimy water where a dim
bulk moved, which was only an alligator
hunting for his breakfast.</p>
<p>Hale Oakham, as long and lanky and
level-eyed as Charles Lindbergh, ran
despairing fingers through his damp
hair and groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can I find this jungle village
without a guide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>caboclo</i> shrugged. &ldquo;The village
will find you. It is bewitched,
master. But you will soon see the path
through the <i>matto</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you stay by me until time to
land? I don&rsquo;t like the looks of these
alligators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is better for a white man to face
an alligator than for a <i>caboclo</i> to face
an Ungapuk. Once they used to kill
and eat us for our strength. Now&mdash;&rdquo;
Again his shrug was eloquent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo; Hale prompted impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white god who put a spell on
these one-time cannibals will bewitch
us and make us wash and rejoice when
it is time to die.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>He</span> shuddered and spat at a cayman
that was lumbering away from
his <i>batalõe.</i></p>
<p>Hale Oakham laughed, a hearty boyish
laugh for a rather learned young
professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all they do to you?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. All who enter this magic
<i>matto</i> die soon, rejoicing. Before the
last breath comes, it is said their bodies
turn into a handful of silver dust&mdash;poof!&mdash;like
that.&rdquo; He snapped his
dirty fingers. &ldquo;Then the life that
leaves them goes into rocks that walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale sighed resignedly. There
wasn&rsquo;t any use to argue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unload your <i>batalõe</i>,&rdquo; he ordered
testily, &ldquo;and get your filthy carcasses
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-breeds obeyed readily. As
the departing <i>batalõe</i> turned from the
<i>igarapé</i> into the open water of the
river, the young man repressed a sudden
lifting of his scalp. He was in for
it now!</p>
<p>His long body sprawled out in the
<i>batalõe</i>, he paddled about aimlessly for
several minutes until he found an aisle
through the jungle&mdash;the path that led
to the jungle village which he was visiting
in the name of science, and for a
certain award.</p>
<p>Before plunging into that waiting
tangle where life and death carried on
a visible, unceasing struggle, he hesitated.
Instinctively he shrank from
losing himself in that mad green world.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>He</span> had first heard of the Ungapuks
at the convention of the Nescience
Club in New York, that body of
scientists, near-scientists and adventurers
linked together for the purpose
of awarding the yearly Woolman
prizes for the most spectacular addition
of empiric facts to various
branches of science. One of the members
of the club, an explorer, had told
a wild yarn about a tribe of Brazilian
Indians, headed by Sir Basil Addington,
an English scientist, who was conducting
secret experiments in biochemistry
in his jungle laboratory. The explorer
had said that the scientist, half-crazed
by a powerful narcotic, had
seemingly discovered some secret of
life which enabled him to produce
monsters in his laboratory and to
change the physical characteristics of
the Ungapuk Indians, who, in five
years, had been transformed from cannibals
into cultured men and women.</p>
<p>And now Hale Oakham, hoping to
win one of the Woolman prizes, was
here in the country of the Ungapuks,
entering the jungle path that lead to
the unknown.</p>
<p>Fifty feet from the <i>igarapé</i>, the path
curved sharply away from a giant tree.
Hale approached the bend with his
hand on his gun. Just before he
reached it, he stopped suddenly to listen.</p>
<p>A woman&rsquo;s voice had suddenly
broken forth in a wild, incredibly
sweet song. Hale stood entranced,
drinking in the heady sounds that
stirred his emotions like <i>masata</i>, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
jungle intoxicant. The singer approached
the bend in the path, while
the young man waited eagerly.</p>
<p>The first sight of her made him gasp.
He had expected to see an Indian girl.
No sane traveler would imagine a
white woman in the Amazon jungle,
with skin as amazingly pale as the
great, fleshy victoria regia lilies in the
<i>igarapé</i>.</p>
<p>When she saw Hale, she stopped instantly.
With a quick, practiced twist,
she reached for the bow flung across
her shoulders and fitted a barbed arrow
to the string.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>She</span> was a beautiful barbarian,
standing quivering before him. In
the thick dull gold braids hanging over
her bare shoulders flamed two enormous
scarlet flowers, no redder than
her own lips pouted in alarm. There
was a savage brevity to her clothing,
which consisted only of a short skirt
of rough native grass and breastplates
of beaten gold, held in place by strings
of colored seeds.</p>
<p>The girl held out an imperious hand
and, in perfect English, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale drew his long body up to its
slim height, folded his arms, and gave
her his most winning smile. His insolence
added to his wholesome good
looks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come
a couple of thousand miles to call on
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw that the eyes which held his
levelly were pure and limpid, and of an
astonishing orchid-blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Her throaty, vibrant
voice was a thing of the flesh,
whipping Hale&rsquo;s senses to sudden madness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Hale Oakham,&rdquo; he said, a little
tremulously, &ldquo;a lone, would-be scientist
knocking about the jungle. Won&rsquo;t
you tell me your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded gravely. &ldquo;I am Aña. I,
too, am white.&rdquo; Her rich voice was
quietly proud. &ldquo;Come; I&rsquo;ll see if Aimu
will receive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With surprising, childlike trust,
she held out her little hand to him.
The gesture was so delightfully natural
that Hale, grinning boyishly, took
her hand and held it as they walked
down the jungle path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sing for me,&rdquo; he demanded abruptly.
&ldquo;Sing the song you sang just
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That?&rdquo; asked the girl, turning the
virgin-blue fire of her eyes on him.
&ldquo;That was my death-song that I practice
each day. Perhaps soon I shall be
released from this.&rdquo; She passed her
hands over her beautiful, half-clothed
body.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Hale&rsquo;s</span> warm glance swept over
her. &ldquo;Do you want to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; don&rsquo;t you? But you do not,
or you would not have retreated from
my poisoned arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Aña; I want to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To live&mdash;and be a slave of <i>this</i>?&rdquo;
Again her hand went over her slim
body. &ldquo;A slave of a pile of flesh that
you must feed and protect from the
agonies that attack it on every side?
Bah! But I am hoping that my turn
will come next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your turn for what, Aña?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To enter the Room of Release. Perhaps,
if Aimu approves of you, you,
too, may taste of death.&rdquo; Her gentle
smile was beatific.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you speak of Sir Basil Addington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was called that once, before he
came to us. Now he has no name. We
can find none holy enough for him;
and so we call him Aimu, which means
good friend.&rdquo; Her beautiful face was
sweet with reverence.</p>
<p>And now, in the distance, Hale saw
that the path led into a large clearing.
He slowed his pace, for he wanted to
know this lovely girl better before he
joined the Ungapuks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, Aña?&rdquo; he asked suddenly,
bending closer to the crinkled,
dull-gold hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Aña, a white woman.&rdquo; She
looked at him frankly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But who are your parents, and how
did you get among the Ungapuks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aña&rsquo;s red lips curved into a dewy
smile. &ldquo;I thought all white men were
wise, like Aimu. But you are stupid.
How do you think a white woman
could appear in a tribe of Indians who
live in the jungle, many weeks&rsquo; journey
from what you call civilization?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale looked a little blank and more
than a little disconcerted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I am stupid,&rdquo; he said
dryly. &ldquo;But tell me, Aña, how did you
get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;he made
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made you? Good Lord! What do
you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I said, Hale Oakham. If
he can take a few grains of dust and
make a shoot that will grow into a
giant tree like yonder monster itauba,
don&rsquo;t you think he can create a small
white girl like me?&rdquo; Her orchid-blue
eyes glowed innocently into his.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> eager questions that he would
have asked froze upon his lips, for
a party of Indians approached.</p>
<p>The six nearly naked red men came
close and surveyed him, toying nervously
with their primitive, feather-decorated
weapons.</p>
<p>A tall, handsome young fellow who
possessed something of the picturesque
perfection of the North American
plains&rsquo; Indian stepped forward and, in
perfect English, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, white stranger.
What is it you wish of the Ungapuks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to see your white <i>cacique</i>,&rdquo;
said Hale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aimu? What is it you wish of
Aimu? He is ours, white stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is yours. I come as a friend,
perhaps to help him in his great work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo; The young Indian folded
his bronze, muscular arms over his
broad chest and continued his cool survey
of Hale. &ldquo;White men before you
have come: spies and thieves. Some
we poisoned with curari. Others Aimu
took into the Room of Release.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Aña, who was still
standing by Hale, and his expression
softened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do with him, Aña?&rdquo;
he asked the question, a fleeting look
of hunger swept his fine, flashing eyes.</p>
<p>Aña flushed beautifully, and, moving
closer to Hale, with an impulsive, almost
childish gesture, slipped her arm
through his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us take him to our village,
Unani Assu!&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;I like
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Hale&rsquo;s turn to flush, which he
did like a schoolboy.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Unani Assu&rsquo;s</span> brows drew together
in a scowl. The hand
holding his blow-pipe jerked convulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aña! Come away!&rdquo; he growled.
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t touch a stranger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aña&rsquo;s blue eyes stretched with astonishment.
&ldquo;But I like to touch him,
Unani Assu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall Indian, with a half comical
gesture of despair, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misunderstand her, stranger.
She is young, very young, ah! And
she has known only the reborn men of
the Ungapuks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped firmly over to Aña, and,
taking the girl by the arm, drew her
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run ahead,&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;and
tell Aimu that we come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aña, her feathered bamboo anklets
clicking together, sped away.</p>
<p>Unani Assu bowed courteously to
Hale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, stranger. If you are an enemy,
it is you who must fear.&rdquo; He
motioned for him to proceed down the
jungle path.</p>
<p>The path ended at a clearing studded
with <i>moloccas</i>, the Indian grass huts
made of plaited straw. Altogether the
scene was peaceful and sane and far
removed from the strange tales that
Hale had heard concerning the Ungapuks.</p>
<p>Hale was conducted to a long, low
stone building, where, in the doorway,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
stood a tall and emaciated white man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aimu!&rdquo; said the Indians reverently,
and bowed themselves.</p>
<p>Over the bare, brown backs, the
white man looked at Hale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Basil Addington?&rdquo; asked the
young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You are welcome. Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale entered the building.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>He</span> was in a book-filled study, furnished
with hand-made chairs
and a desk. Sir Basil asked him to be
seated. He offered the young man
long, brown native cigarettes and a
very good drink made from yucca.</p>
<p>After several minutes of conversation,
Sir Basil suddenly changed his
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he shot out, eyeing the
young man through narrowed lids,
&ldquo;will you please state the purpose of
this visit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale looked squarely at his questioner.
&ldquo;Frankly, Sir Basil, I have
called on you because I am so intensely
interested in your work among the
Ungapuks that I wish to offer my services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave in detail his family history,
his education, and his experience as a
teacher and a scientist.</p>
<p>Sir Basil tapped his teeth thoughtfully
with a pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you think you can be
of assistance to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, of course, is for you to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale thought that the scientist
looked like a huge, starved crow in his
loose-fitting coat. He was so fleshless
that, when the light fell strongly on
his face as it now did, the bones of his
head and hands showed through the
skin with horrible clearness.</p>
<p>Hale, under Sir Basil&rsquo;s scrutiny, decided
instantly that he did not like
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need a helper,&rdquo; the scientist went
on, with the air of talking to himself.
&ldquo;A white assistant who neither loves
nor fears me. Unani Assu is good
enough in his way, but I need a helper
who has had technical training.&rdquo; Suddenly
he wheeled on Hale and asked
sharply, &ldquo;How are your nerves, young
man?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Hale</span> started, but managed to answer
calmly. &ldquo;Excellent. My
war record isn&rsquo;t half bad, and that was
surely backed with good nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you say you have no close relatives,
no ties of any sort to interfere
with work that is dangerous&mdash;and
something else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul would care if I passed
out to-day, Sir Basil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! And now tell me this: are
you one of those scientists whose minds
are so mechanical, so mathematically
made, as it were, that your entire outlook
on science is based on old, established
beliefs, or do you belong to that
rare but modern type of trained
thinker and dreamer who refuse to
permit yesterday&rsquo;s convictions to influence
to-day&rsquo;s visions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale smiled quietly. &ldquo;I recently
lost my chair in a famous university
because of my so-called unscientific
teachings regarding ether-drift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Expressing himself in purely scientific
terms, he went into an elaboration
of his revolutionary theory. When he
had finished, Sir Basil reached out his
clawlike hand to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he approved. &ldquo;You have
dared to think originally. Now listen
to my theory of mind-electrons which
has grown into the established fact that
I have discovered the secret of life and
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The long, thin hands reached into a
pocket for a box of pills. He swallowed
one greedily, and immediately
his emaciated face seemed charged
with new virility.</p>
<p>He spoke out suddenly. &ldquo;Our world,
you know, is made up of three powers:
matter, energy and what you call
life. I might really say that there are
but two powers, for matter, in its last
analysis, is a form of energy. And
what is life? You can&rsquo;t call it a form
of energy, for every inorganic atom has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
energy without having life. Life, Mr.
Oakham, is mind or consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began pacing the floor restlessly.
&ldquo;Everything that lives has this consciousness,
and I say this in defiance
of some fixed scientific views. The
amoeba in a stagnant pool, a thallophyte
on a bit of old bread, any of the
myriads of trees and plants that you
see in the jungle all have consciousness
as well as you. And why?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>He</span> brought his fist down upon the
table. &ldquo;Because they issue from
the same source as you and I, the almighty
mind, eternal, indestructible,
which has permitted itself to be enslaved
by matter. You are Hale Oakham.
I am Basil Addington, yet we
are one and the same. Let me illustrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seized a glass and poured it full
of <i>masata</i>. &ldquo;Look! Two portions of
<i>masata</i>. But I pour what is in the glass
back into the bottle. The molecules
cohere and the two portions become
one again. Some day you and I&mdash;our
individual consciousnesses&mdash;will flow
back to the Whole. That sounds mystical,
but listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We scientists hold that the electron
explains nearly all the physical and
chemical phenomena. I go further and
say that it explains <i>all</i>. Matter, electricity,
light, heat, magnetism&mdash;all can
be reduced to the ultimate unit. So,
Mr. Oakham, I am going to make clear
to you how life itself is electronic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His long finger touched Hale&rsquo;s arm.
&ldquo;You, I, yonder mosquito on your
sleeve, even one of the germs that is
causing my malaria, all being individual
living things, are the ultimate units
of what I shall personify as the Mind.
When I say <i>you</i> I do not speak of that
mound of flesh in which you exist, and
which can be reduced to the same familiar
basic elements and compounds
as make up inorganic structures; I
speak of your mind, your consciousness&mdash;for
that is the real you. Are you
following me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly, Sir Basil.&rdquo; Hale reached
for another drink. &ldquo;But do you mean
to say that you and I are no more than
a mosquito, a malaria protozoan, or
even one of those trees in the jungle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Basil&rsquo;s dry skin slipped back into
a long smile. &ldquo;Startling, isn&rsquo;t it?
You, I, and all other living organisms
are nothing but matter, energy and
consciousness. You and I have a
larger share of consciousness, because
our organic structure permits the mind-electrons
greater freedom over the matter
than composes our bodies. We are
more acutely aware of the universe
about us, have a greater facility for enjoyment
and suffering, a more intricate
brain and nervous system. Yet when
our bodies die and our consciousness is
released, the mind-electrons enslaved
by our atoms go back to the elemental
Whole. This holds good for the
protozoan, the tree, the man&mdash;for all
things that live.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Hale</span> was drinking again. &ldquo;You
mean, Sir Basil, that there is a
sort of war waged against what you
personify as the Mind by matter; that
matter is constantly seeking to enslave
mind-electrons, so that it may become
an organism which, for awhile, may enjoy
what we call life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Basil pushed back his tufted hair
and looked happy. &ldquo;Yes! And it&rsquo;s Nature&rsquo;s
supreme blunder! In the end,
the Mind always conquers and gains
its release, yet the eternal chain of enslavement
goes on and on, and will
continue to go on as long as there is a
living organism in the world to bind
mind to matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale was excited now, as much from
the fiery intoxicant as from the scientist&rsquo;s
weird revelation. &ldquo;I get you,&rdquo; he
said, rather inelegantly for a professor.
&ldquo;You mean that if every living
thing in the world should pass out,
every man, every plant, every animal,
even down to microscopic infusoria,
the Mind would collect all its electrons,
and through some more jealous
law of, er, cohesion hold these electrons
inviolate from matter and energy?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Right! And again, as in the beginning,
the Mind would rule supreme.
By what I have proved, you and I and
all other creatures that now have life
may, as separate unfleshed electrons,
enjoy eternal consciousness as a part
of the Mind.&rdquo; A new passion leaped
to his dark eyes. &ldquo;When I have finished
my mission, no more need we be
slaves of the dust, subject to all the
frightful sufferings of this dunghill
of flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought his fist down upon his
skinny leg with a resounding blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you cannot reduce your theory
to fact, Sir Basil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Again came that frightful
grin to his cadaverous face. &ldquo;Can you
withstand shock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean shock to the eye, let
me remind you that I served two years
in the big fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come to my laboratory. Better
take another drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Hale helped himself again
from the <i>masata</i> bottle, Sir Basil swallowed
another pellet.</p>
<p>Then the two went into the adjoining
apartment.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Sir</span> Basil, his hand over the doorknob,
paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we go in,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want
you to remember that we call natural
that which is characteristic of the physical
world. Everything alive in this
laboratory was produced by nature. I
merely made available the materials,
or, rather, I made the conditions under
which matter was able to enslave mind-electrons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door, slipped his body
through, and, with his ugly, teeth-revealing
grin, gestured for Hale to follow
him.</p>
<p>Hale steeled himself and looked
around half fearfully. The first glance
took in a large and well-equipped
laboratory, somewhat fetid with animal
odors. The second lingered here and
there on cages, aquariums, incubators,
and other containers where creatures
moved.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as something scuttled
across the floor and disappeared into
a hole in the wall, Hale cried out and
covered his eyes with a hand.</p>
<p>Sir Basil laughed aloud. &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t you examine it closer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale looked nauseated. &ldquo;My God,
Sir Basil! A rat with a man&rsquo;s head and
face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Basil&rsquo;s voice was sharp, decisive.
&ldquo;Before you leave this laboratory,
you&rsquo;re going to come out of your foolish
belief that man is a creature apart
from other living organisms. You&mdash;the
conscious you&mdash;is no greater, no
more important in the final balance
than the spark of consciousness in that
rat. When your body and the rat&rsquo;s
body give up their atoms to nature&rsquo;s
laboratory, the little enslaved mind-electron
that is you and the one that
is the rat will be identical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Hale shivered and turned
away from that cold, too-thin face.</p>
<p>The scientist was speaking. &ldquo;Step
around to all those cages and pens. I
want you to see all my slaves of the
dust.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>But</span> long before Hale had encircled
the room, he was so disturbed
at what he saw that he could
scarcely complete his frightful inspection.
In every enclosure he viewed a
monstrosity that in some way resembled
a human. Every reptile, every insect,
every queer, misshapen animal not
only looked human in some shocking
manner, but also seemed to possess human
characteristics. It seemed as
though some demented creator with a
perverted sense of humor had attempted
to mock man by calling forth monsters
in his image.</p>
<p>At last the young man cried out:
&ldquo;How did you breed these freaks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not freaks, and I did not
breed them. They are nature&rsquo;s parentless
products whose basic elements
were brought together in this laboratory,
and, by a scientific reproduction
of the functions of creation, endowed
with the life principle, which is merely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
mind-electrons.&rdquo; He smoothed his long
tuft of hair nervously. &ldquo;Would you
like to see how life springs from a
wedding of matter, energy, and consciousness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect I can stand anything
now,&rdquo; Hale admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come and peep into a very remarkable
group of apparatus I have
developed, where you can watch atoms
building molecules and molecules
building living organisms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say I can see atoms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not directly, of course. The light
waves will forever prevent us from
actually seeing the atom. But I have
perfected a system of photography
which magnifies particles smaller than
light waves, and, separating their images
from the light waves, renders detail
clear in the moving pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>He</span> went to a huge machine or
series of machines which took up
all the center floor space of the laboratory,
where he busied himself in an
intricate network of wires, mirrors,
electrodes, ray projectors, and traveling
metal compartments. Presently he
called out to Hale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me remind you, Oakham, that
while any scientist can break up any
of the various proteid molecules which
are the basis of all living cells, animal
and vegetable, no scientist before me
has been able to compound the atoms
and build them into a proteid molecule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bared his teeth in the smile that
Hale hated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am proud to tell you that the proteid
molecule can be built up only
when the third element of nature&rsquo;s
trinity is added&mdash;the mind-electron. I
have found a means of capturing the
mind-electron and of bringing it in
contact with proteid elements. And
now it is possible to bring forth life
in the laboratory. Come closer and
watch proteid forming protoplasm,
protoplasm forming a cell, and the cell
evolving into&mdash;well, what do you want,
an animal, plant, or an insect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale had fallen under the scientist&rsquo;s
spell. He did not feel foolish when he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a rat!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Hale</span> became so absorbed in the
wonders of the laboratory that
when lunch time came, Sir Basil had
food brought to them. While they
were eating a very good vegetable stew,
farina, and luscious tropical fruits, a
sudden, agonized scream rang out, followed
by other screams and wails.</p>
<p>Sir Basil opened the door and looked
out. Aña came running forward. Her
blue eyes were flooded with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aimu!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;A tree
fell on Unani Assu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She buried her beautiful face in her
hands and sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>Sir Basil frowned heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t lose Unani Assu yet,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;He is a wonderful help
around the laboratory. Is he dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. We should rejoice if his time
of release had come. But his legs,
Aimu! No one wants to suffer and be
crippled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even in her distress, the girl&rsquo;s voice
was rich and vibrant, and every tone
moved Hale curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; cried the scientist. &ldquo;Have
them bring him here before he dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl leaped to her feet and sped
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Oakham,&rdquo; continued Sir Basil.
&ldquo;Here is a rare opportunity for
you to see how completely I have mastered
the laws that govern organic matter.
Help me prepare.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>For</span> several minutes, Hale worked
under the scientist&rsquo;s sharply spoken
directions. By the time the injured
man was brought to the laboratory,
Sir Basil was ready for him.</p>
<p>Unani Assu was still conscious, but
his pale face indicated that he had lost
much blood. When the improvised
stretcher was lowered to the floor, Sir
Basil sent all the Indians away.</p>
<p>Unani Assu opened his eyes and
called feebly, &ldquo;Aña!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Be still!&rdquo; ordered Sir Basil. &ldquo;Aña
is not here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please!&rdquo; gasped the dying man. &ldquo;I
want her&mdash;my Aña!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Basil sucked in his breath sharply.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Have you been
making love to Aña again, after my
warning to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sufferer stirred uneasily. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
he panted. &ldquo;But perhaps my hour of
release has come, and I want to look
at her&mdash;once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scientist smiled unpleasantly as
he eyed the magnificent body which
looked like a broken statue in bronze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some human characteristics are
strange,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;In spite of
everything I do, this fellow continues
to love Aña: Aña whom I intend for
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped to the apparatus and
swiftly changed one of the adjustments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he resumed, with a gleam
in his eyes that chilled Hale, &ldquo;this will
forever cure him.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>In</span> another moment, the still, half-dead
body was lifted and gently
slipped into a compartment.</p>
<p>Before Hale&rsquo;s horrified gaze fastened
on the eye-piece which revealed
moving pictures of every process that
went on within, Unani Assu&rsquo;s body was
reduced almost instantly to a fine, silvery
dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You have
killed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scientist&rsquo;s teeth showed in his
wide smile. &ldquo;Think so? Does a woman
destroy a dress when she rips it up to
make it over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean me to understand that
you can reduce a living body to its
basic elements and then rebuild these
elements into a remade man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch!&rdquo; warned the scientist.</p>
<p>Hale looked again and saw the silver
dust that was once a living body
being whirled into a tiny, grublike
thing. He saw the grub expand into an
embryo, and the embryo develop into
a foetus. From now on the development
was slower, and he often stopped
to talk with Sir Basil.</p>
<p>Once he asked: &ldquo;If this man had
died naturally, could you have brought
him back to life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Basil shook his head. &ldquo;No.
When once the mind-electron is completely
freed from its enslavement by
matter, it is forever beyond recall by
the body it has just vacated. Like
atomic electrons, whose equilibrium
disturbed break away from their planetary
system and go dashing off into
space, only to be drawn into another
planetary system, the mind-electron
may be enslaved almost immediately by
extraneous matter. Had Unani Assu
died, his liberated mind-electron might
at once have been captured by a jungle
flower going to seed. Immediately a
new seed would be started. And now
the former Unani Assu would be a
seed of a jungle flower, later to find
new life as a plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the scientist threw up his
hand and cried: &ldquo;You see? The Mind
will be eternally enslaved as long as
there is life! Oh, for the time of deliverance!&rdquo;
He gazed fanatically into
space, as though he dreamed magnificently.</p>
<p>Hale observed him thoughtfully.
When that great brain weakened, the
consequences would be frightful.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Sir Basil,</span> as though he had made
a sudden decision, went over to
that part of his machine which he
called the molecule-disintegrator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oakham!&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;I have
taken you partly into my confidence.
Now I want to show you something.
Come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale obeyed with misgivings. The
scientist pointed out the window to a
group of Indians, anxious relatives of
Unani Assu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch!&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>Turning one of the projectors on the
machine toward the window, he sighted
carefully and pressed a button.</p>
<p>Immediately one of the Indians fell
to the ground and struggled. His companions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
began dancing around him in
evident joy. Faintly to the laboratory
came a familiar chant, which Hale recognized as
Aña&rsquo;s death song.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>Dust to dust<br />
Mind to Mind&mdash;<br />
He will shed his body<br />
As the green snake sheds his skin.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>As Hale watched, the struggling Indian&rsquo;s
body seemed to shrink, and then,
instantly, it disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch them scatter the dust!&rdquo; said
the scientist.</p>
<p>One of the Indians stooped and blew
upon the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done!&rdquo; Hale
gasped. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve killed this one. Oh,
I see now! These poor devils are totally
ignorant that you are killing them
for practice. They worship you while
you turn them to&mdash;silver dust!&rdquo; He
turned angrily on the scientist as
though he longed to strike him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep cool, young man!&rdquo; Sir Basil
held up his fleshless hand. &ldquo;There is
no death! Change, yes; but no permanent
blotting out of consciousness.
Can&rsquo;t you see the horror of it as nature
works? When your time for release
comes, as it inevitably will, your mind-electron
might find new enslavement in
a worm!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Hale&rsquo;s</span> reply came hotly. &ldquo;If that
is true, why do you murder these
poor devils deliberately!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Oakham, perhaps you are
not so brilliant as I had hoped! All
that I have done thus far is only child&rsquo;s
play, in preparation for my real work.
Haven&rsquo;t you guessed by now what I
am getting ready to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m a poor guesser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scientist made a gesture of mock
despair. &ldquo;Then let me tell you. The
molecule-disintegrator is active only
on organic structures. When I concentrate
it so&rdquo;&mdash;he reached out again,
sighted the projector on some point beyond
the window and pressed a button&mdash;&ldquo;one
single living organism passes
out. See that jupati tree by the rock
disappear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Hale&rsquo;s eyes, the tall, slender
tree melted into air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Sir Basil, &ldquo;if I
should <i>broadcast</i> my molecule-disintegrator
on electron magnetic waves,
destruction would pass out in all directions,
following the curve of the earth&rsquo;s
surface, penetrating earth, air, water.&rdquo;
He wet his lips carefully. &ldquo;You understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale stiffened suddenly. &ldquo;I understand.
No life could survive these vibrations
of destruction? Through
every corner of the earth where life
lurks, they would reach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; cried Sir Basil. &ldquo;There
would be not a blade of grass, not a
living spore, not a hidden egg! Think
of it, Oakham! No more would the
clean air and the sweet earth reek with
life, and at last the ultimate mind-electron
would be released forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was breathing fast, and his emaciated
face burned with two red spots.</p>
<p>Hale thought rapidly. He was convinced
now that the fate of all life
lay within that diabolical network of
chemical apparatus.</p>
<p>At last he said: &ldquo;And what of you
and I, Sir Basil? Shall we, too, be
caught in this wholesale destruction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not immediately,&rdquo; replied the scientist.
&ldquo;Of course, I want to remain
in the flesh long enough to be sure that
my purpose has been accomplished. I
have provided a way for my own
safety. If you desire, you may remain
with me.&rdquo; He smiled craftily. &ldquo;I have
planned to keep Aña also, the woman
whom I called into life and made as I
wished.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>His</span> words pounded against Hale&rsquo;s
tortured ears with almost physical
force. With a supreme effort, the
young man controlled his rage and despair.
Aña needed him too much now
for him to risk defeat by showing his
emotions.</p>
<p>To Sir Basil he said: &ldquo;But if all life
disappears from the earth, what shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
we do for food&mdash;you, Aña, and I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Basil lifted his brows. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t think I overlooked that, do you?
What is food? Various combinations
of the basic elements. I who have conquered
the atom need never worry
about starving to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time, the machinery had
been humming, and now the humming
changed its note to a shrill whistle. Sir
Basil went to the eye-piece and looked
into it. Opening a door in the machinery,
he disappeared inside. He came
out soon, flushed and evidently elated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring the stretcher, Oakham,&rdquo; he
ordered.</p>
<p>Hale brought the stretcher, placing it
close to the machine. Then Sir Basil
opened a metal door and gently eased
out a human body.</p>
<p>It was Unani Assu, unconscious but
alive and breathing. Hale, helping the
scientist to get the man on the
stretcher, noticed that the crushed legs
were perfectly healed. Together they
bore him to a long seat. The Indian&rsquo;s
eyes were still closed, but his even
breathing indicated that he was only
sleeping.</p>
<p>Suddenly Hale pointed a finger and
cried out. &ldquo;My God, Sir Basil, look at
his hands and feet!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Unani Assu,</span> still lying like a recumbent
bronze statue sculptured
by a master, was perfect from shoulder
to wrist, from thigh to ankle. But,
somewhere in that diabolical machine
through which he had passed, his hands
and feet had undergone a hideous metamorphism
which had transformed them
from the well-formed extremities of a
splendid young Indian into the hairy
paws of a giant rat!</p>
<p>Hale turned away his head, sick with
disgust.</p>
<p>Sir Basil cut the silence triumphantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now he&rsquo;ll never again face Aña with
love in his eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; broke in Hale. &ldquo;Did you
plan this monstrous thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course! I told you I should forever
cure him of his mad infatuation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you kill him, as
you killed the others? It would have
been the most merciful way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Basil showed his teeth in his ugly
smile. &ldquo;A creator is never merciful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A quiver passed through the Indian&rsquo;s
body and presently, he sighed deeply
and opened his eyes. He seemed dazed,
puzzled. He looked from Hale to the
scientist, and turned seeking eyes to
other parts of the laboratory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aña!&rdquo; he called weakly. &ldquo;Where is
Aña?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled himself a little unsteadily
to his feet&mdash;to the spatulated, hairy <i>rodent</i>
feet that had come out of the
life-machine. Staggering, he would
have fallen, had he not thrown out his
arm to steady himself. Instinctively
he tried to grasp something for support,
and then, for the first time, he
discovered his deformity.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Hale</span> was never to forget that expression
of horror and disgust
that swept over the Indian&rsquo;s face as he
spread open his revolting extremities
and stared at them.</p>
<p>A sudden, wild roar of despair rang
through the room. &ldquo;Aimu! My hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scientist smiled with evident
amusement. &ldquo;You are a grotesque
sight, Unani Assu. Do you want to
see Aña now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fright and horror faded from
the Indian&rsquo;s face, for now he glared
with hate into the mad, mocking eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did it!&rdquo; the Indian ground out.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made me into a thing from
which Aña will run screaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the quiet rage of the perfectly
spoken English ran a thread of
sorrow. &ldquo;Aimu, whom we considered
too holy to name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Choking, he hobbled away to the
door, which he unbolted. As he passed
out into the open, Sir Basil went over
to the machine and began sighting the
projector which cast forth the ray of
destruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Hale. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done
enough murder for to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></div>
<p>The scientist paused. &ldquo;I was trying
to be merciful. And then, I wonder
if it is safe to let him go, hating me?
Oh, well!&rdquo; He shrugged his narrow
shoulders. &ldquo;I seldom leave the laboratory,
and certainly nothing can harm
me here.&rdquo; He touched the death-projector
significantly.</p>
<p>Hale made a mental decision. &ldquo;I
must find out how the damned thing
works and put it out of commission.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>With</span> this determination uppermost
in his mind, he assumed a
more intense interest in the strange
laboratory. For the next two days, he
assisted Sir Basil so assiduously that
he learned much about the operation of
the life-machine. And gradually he
stopped being horrified as the fascination
of producing life in the laboratory
grew upon him.</p>
<p>After he had assisted the scientist
in building living organisms from basic
elements, he ceased to cringe when he
remembered that perhaps it was true
that Aña was created in the mysterious
life-machine.</p>
<p>Once the scientist declared, &ldquo;She is
untainted with inheritance. She is the
perfect mate that I called into life so
that before I pass from the flesh I may
taste that one human emotion I&rsquo;ve
never experienced&mdash;love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That very night Hale kept a secret
tryst with Aña after the village slept.
Sweet, virginal Aña, who knew less of
the world than a civilized child of
twelve&mdash;what a sensation she would
create in New York with her beauty,
her culture, her natural fascination!
With her in his arms and an orange
tropical moon hanging low in the hot,
black sky, he ceased to care that she
had no ancestors, for now his one passionate
desire was to save her from
Sir Basil and to hold her forever for
himself.</p>
<p>He might have been content to go
on like this for months, tampering with
creation in the day time, courting Aña
in secret at night, had not Unani Assu
come back for revenge.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>On</span> the fourth night after Unani
Assu had disappeared into the
jungle, Hale went to the <i>igarapé</i> to
meet Aña. He had gone only half the
distance when he encountered her, running
frantically up the path toward
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hale!&rdquo; she gasped, falling into his
opened arms, where she lay panting and
exhausted.</p>
<p>Hale gently patted the long braids,
shimmering in silver tangles under the
moonlight, and, crushing the soft little
trembling body close, he murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dug her face deeper into the
bend of his arm. &ldquo;Oh, Hale! I saw
Unani Assu a few minutes ago.&rdquo; For
several moments she was unable to go
on, for sudden sobs cut off her breath.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible, Hale, what Aimu did to
his hands and feet, but what Unani&rsquo;s
going to do to Aimu is still more terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale placed his hand gently under
her chin and tilted up her small, pale,
tear-drenched face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be calm, Aña, and tell me plainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still clinging to him, she went on.
&ldquo;He told me that Aimu is a devil,
Hale. He showed me his hands and
asked me if I could ever get used to
them and be&mdash;his squaw.&rdquo; The round
gold breastplates and the necklace of
painted seeds clinked together over
her panting bosom. &ldquo;I told him about
you, Hale. And then he seemed to go
mad. He said he&rsquo;d kill Aimu to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Aña! Why did he let you go,
knowing that you would give the
alarm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t let me go.&rdquo; Her petaled
lips parted in a faint smile. &ldquo;I escaped.
Unani Assu tied me to a tree by the
<i>igarapé</i>. Because he doesn&rsquo;t ... hate
me, he could not bear to tie me too
tightly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he must be close to the laboratory
now. If he breaks in upon Aimu&mdash;oh,
my God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale remembered the death-projector.
If Sir Basil were in danger of attack,
he would not hesitate to touch the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
waiting button that would broadcast
death throughout the world.</p>
<p>He seized Aña&rsquo;s little hand and cried
out: &ldquo;Run, Aña! The only safe place
now is Aimu&rsquo;s laboratory. Run!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>As</span> they dashed on madly, Hale
opened wide his nostrils to scent
the heavy, flower-laden air of the
jungle. Any moment all this sweet, rich
life might vanish instantly. He had a
horrible vision of a world devoid of
life, a world of bare rocks, dry sand,
odorless, dead waters. For it was life
that greened the landscape, roughened
the stones with moss and lichen, thickened
the ocean with ooze, and turned
the dry sand into loam&mdash;life that
swarmed underfoot, overhead, all
around!</p>
<p>And now, just as they reached the
laboratory door, panting and frantic, a
hoarse shriek broke forth. Dragging
Aña after him, Hale dashed forward,
conscious of two masculine voices
raised in passion.</p>
<p>The door to the room where the life-machine
performed its vile work was
locked. Hale pounded against it and
called out to Sir Basil, but only curses
and the sound of tumbling bodies came
from beyond the door. Although originally
the door had been thick and
strong, the destructive forces of the
tropics had pitted and rotted the wood.
A few blows of Hale&rsquo;s shoulder broke
it down.</p>
<p>Under the brilliant electric light, Sir
Basil and Unani Assu were fighting
upon the blood-spattered floor. The
struggle was uneven: the scientist&rsquo;s
emaciated body was no match for the
splendid strength of the young Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help Aimu!&rdquo; cried Aña, pushing
Hale forward.</p>
<p>Aimu was being choked to death.</p>
<p>Hale acted fantastically but efficiently.
Catching up a bottle of ammonia,
he moistened a handkerchief
and clapped it against Unani Assu&rsquo;s
nose. Instantly the Indian choked, released
Sir Basil, and fell back, gasping
for breath.</p>
<p>Hale thrust the handkerchief into
his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; he ordered Unani Assu.
&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; He threatened him with the
ammonia bottle.</p>
<p>But Unani Assu was not looking at
the bottle. &ldquo;Aimu!&rdquo; he screamed,
pointing.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>When</span> Hale saw and understood,
he leaped across the room to
plant his body in front of Aña; for
Sir Basil was behind the life-machine,
reaching for the controls of the ray
projector.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from behind Hale, a silver
streak shot across the room. Sir Basil
groaned and sank to the floor of the
laboratory.</p>
<p>A keen-bladed dissecting knife,
thrown by Aña, stuck out from his left
breast.</p>
<p>Aña ran forward, sobbing wildly.
&ldquo;Oh, Aimu! I&rsquo;m sorry! I didn&rsquo;t mean
for it to strike you there. Only your
hand, Aimu! I didn&rsquo;t want Hale to
die, Aimu. I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was on her knees by the scientist&rsquo;s
side, his head held in her slender
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s breathing!&rdquo; she rejoiced. &ldquo;Some
<i>masata</i>, Hale, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale found a bottle of good brandy
which he had contributed from his
own supplies. Soon Sir Basil gasped
and opened his eyes. He stared about
him wildly, then gasped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying, Hale Oakham! Quick,
the life-machine, before my mind-electron
escapes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to pull his body up, but fell
back, weak and panting.</p>
<p>Hale hesitated, looking doubtfully at
Aña.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, quick!&rdquo; screamed
Sir Basil. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying, I say! I must
have&mdash;rebirth. Lift me to the disintegrator.
Hurry!...&rdquo; His voice
trailed off faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dying,&rdquo; snapped Hale. &ldquo;We
might as well try it.&rdquo; He jerked open
the door to the disintegrator. &ldquo;Here,
Unani Assu! Lend a hand!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Instantly</span> the Indian came forward,
a peculiar, pleased expression
on his handsome face. In a moment,
Sir Basil&rsquo;s body was inside, and the
machine began its weird humming, the
humming that indicated the transformation
of a human body into dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; cried Unani Assu exultingly,
going behind the machine. &ldquo;I have
helped him enough to understand that
if one changes this&mdash;and this&mdash;and
this&rdquo;&mdash;he made some rapid adjustments
on the machine&mdash;&ldquo;something that is not
pleasant will happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Hale. &ldquo;What did you
change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian laughed mockingly.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to know? But, yet,
you should not worry. You have no
cause to love him, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be a traitor, Unani Assu!
Arrange the machine as it was originally,
and I give you my word of honor
than when Sir Basil comes out, I&rsquo;ll
wreck the damned thing beyond repair.
See, Unani Assu? You and I together
will smash it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian folded his arms so that
the repulsive things that should have
been hands were hidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late now,&rdquo; he admitted,
shaking his head. &ldquo;Yet I&rsquo;ve done no
more to him than he did to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale went to the eye-piece in the
machine and started to look inside.
Unani Assu stepped forward, tapped
him on the shoulder, and, fingering significantly
the dissecting knife which
he had picked up, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am operating the machine. Will
you sit over there by Aña and wait?
It won&rsquo;t be long. And, white stranger,
remember this: I am your friend. I
am turned against none but our common
enemy.&rdquo; He pointed significantly
to the machine.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Two</span> hours passed, long, silent
hours for the watchers in the
laboratory. Aña fell asleep, in a sweet,
childish bundle upon the piled cushions,
her golden hair, still decorated
with the red flowers which she always
wore, crushed and withered now. Several
times Hale caught Unani Assu
gazing at her sadly, and his own look
saddened when it rested on the Indian&rsquo;s
strong, outraged body.</p>
<p>The humming of the machine
changed to a whistle. Placing his fingers
on his lips in a signal of quiet,
Unani Assu whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Aña sleep. She mustn&rsquo;t see
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opening a door in the machine, his
handsome face lighted with a grim
smile, he whispered exultingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A scuttling sound issued forth and
then, half drunkenly, an enormous rat
tumbled out&mdash;one of those horrible rats
with the hairless, humanlike faces that
had so frequently come from the life-machine.</p>
<p>Hale could not crush back the cry
that issued from his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Sir Basil?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried the Indian, pointing
to the kicking rat, which was fast gaining
strength.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Hale</span> staggered back. &ldquo;No! You
don&rsquo;t mean it, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unani Assu turned the rat over with
a contemptuous toe. &ldquo;Yes, I mean it.
Behold Aimu, the man who thought
himself creator and destroyer&mdash;the man
who said that a human being was no
higher than a rat! Perhaps he was
right, for see this thing that was once
a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale buried his face in his hands.
&ldquo;Kill it, Unani Assu! Kill it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unani Assu&rsquo;s low laugh was metallic.
&ldquo;You kill it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hale uncovered his face. &ldquo;Open the
disintegrator.&rdquo; Gingerly he reached
for the rat&rsquo;s tail.</p>
<p>But his hand never touched the animal.
The hairless face turned for a
second, and the little, beady eyes
blinked up at Hale with an expression
that his fevered imagination thought
almost human. Then, like a dark
shadow, the rat dashed away. Once
around the room it scampered, hunting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
for an exit. Hale started in pursuit.
He was almost upon the animal again,
when, leaping up from his grasp, it
landed on a low shelf where chemicals
were stored. Several bottles fell, filling
the room with fumes.</p>
<p>Another bottle fell, and, suddenly,
amid a thunderous roar, the ceiling and
walls began falling. Some highly explosive
chemical had been stored in one
of the bottles.</p>
<p>Hale was thrown violently against
the couch. His hand touched Aña&rsquo;s
body. One last shred of consciousness
enabled him to pick her up and drag
her out. In the open, he fell, aware,
before blackness descended, that
flames leaped high over the laboratory
building and that Unani Assu lay dead
within.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Hale</span> and Aña, leaning over the
deck-rail of a small steam
launch, gazed into the dark waters of
the Amazon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to reach Para by morning,&rdquo;
said Hale, &ldquo;and then, dearest,
we&rsquo;re off for New York!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aña, wearing one of the first civilized
dresses she had ever donned, and
looking as smart as any débutante,
slipped her little hand into her husband&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a shame, Hale,&rdquo; she moaned,
&ldquo;that the fire burned all the animals
and insects, the machinery, and even
your notes?&rdquo; Her beautiful face saddened.
&ldquo;Just one or two specimens
might have been proof enough for your
What-You-Call-It Club!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Nescience Club, darling. No,
I can&rsquo;t expect to win the Woolman
prize, but I&rsquo;ve won a prize worth far
more.&rdquo; He squeezed her little hand
and looked devotedly into her blue
eyes. &ldquo;And, Aña, I&rsquo;ve reasoned out
something concerning mind-electrons
which even Sir Basil overlooked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Hale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He maintained that matter seeks always
to enslave mind-electrons, but I
am convinced that mind-electrons seek
to enslave matter. Understand? It&rsquo;s
creation, Aña! Had Sir Basil succeeded
in broadcasting death throughout
the world, the freed mind-electrons, as
in the beginning, would have started
again to vitalize inorganic atoms. And,
in a few million years, which is no time
to the Mind, the world would be humming
with a new civilization. Large
thought, eh, sweetheart?&rdquo;</p>

<a name='A_SIGNAL_TO_THE_MOON' id='A_SIGNAL_TO_THE_MOON'></a>
<h2>A SIGNAL TO THE MOON</h2>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> idea of a radio signal to the moon
may sound fantastic, but is easily within
the range of possibility, says Dr. A. Hoyt
Taylor, Chief of the Radio Division of the
United States Naval Research Laboratories
at Washington, who plans such an attempt
in the near future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have reason to expect a good chance
of getting the signal back in a time interval
of slightly less than three seconds,&rdquo; said Dr.
Taylor.</p>
<p>To be exact, a radio signal should be reflected
back to earth in a time interval of
2.8 seconds, this being the necessary elapsed
time for it to carry the 250,000 miles to the
moon and return at its speed of 300,000 kilometers,
or 186,000 miles per second.</p>
<p>The signal would be very weak, Dr. Taylor
points out, but not impossible of detection
with the present refinement of receiving instruments,
provided no great absorption took
place in interstellar space.</p>
<p>A high frequency wave will be used, as
such a wave penetrates readily the earth&rsquo;s
atmosphere and probably goes far beyond.
The frequency of the wave will range between
20,000 and 30,000 kilocycles. Twenty
kilowats of power will be used, enough to
furnish current for about forty flatirons.</p>
<p>The value of a radio signal to the moon
lies in the confirmation of whether there is
or not heavy absorption of waves in the
upper levels of our own atmosphere. If successful
it would indicate a reasonably good
reflection coefficient at the surface of the
moon&mdash;the power of the moon&rsquo;s surface to
act as a joint agent in the perfection of the
signal.</p>
<p>The signal might have some bearing also
on whether the moon has an atmosphere&mdash;something
pretty much settled already by
astronomical observation. It would also lead
to the possibility of fairly accurate determination
of wave velocity in free space, all of interest
to science, either confirming existing
theories or establishing new ones.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>A flash</span> of light on Venus!&mdash;and
at Maricopa Flying Field Lieutenant
McGuire
and Captain
Blake laugh at
its possible meaning
until the radio&rsquo;s
weird call
and the sight of a giant ship in the
night sky prove their wildest thoughts
are facts. &ldquo;Big as an ocean liner,&rdquo; it
hangs in midair, then turns and shoots
upward at incredible speed until it disappears
entirely, in space!</p>
<p class='sidebarright'>It is war. Interplanetary war. And on
far distant Venus two fighting Earthlings
stand up against a whole planet run
amuck.</p>
<p>McGuire goes
to Mount Lawson
observatory, and
there he sees the
flash on Venus repeated.
Professor
Sykes, who had observed the first flash,
confirms it and sees still more. He sees
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
the enveloping clouds of Venus torn
asunder, and beneath them an identifying
mark, a continent shaped like
the letter &ldquo;L.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the great ship comes again.
It hovers above the observatory and
settles slowly down.</p>

<p>Back at Maricopa Field, Captain
Blake has tested a new plane for altitude,
and is now prepared to interview
the stranger in the higher levels. McGuire&rsquo;s
frantic phone call sends him
out into the night with the 91st Squadron
of planes in support. It is their
last flight, for all but Blake. The invader
smothers them in a great sphere
of gas, but Blake, with his oxygen
flasks, flies through to crash beside the
observatory. Only Blake survives to
see the enemy land, while strange man-shapes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
loot the buildings and carry off
McGuire and Sykes.</p>
<p>A bombardment with giant shells
dispels the last doubt of the earth
being under attack. The flashes from
Venus at regular intervals spout death
and destruction upon the earth; a
mammoth gun, sunk into the planet itself,
bears once upon the earth at every
revolution, until the changing position
of the globes take the target out of
range.</p>
<p>In less than a year and a half the
planets must meet again. It is war to
the death; a united world against an
enemy unknown&mdash;an enemy who has
conquered space. And there is less
than a year and a half in which to prepare!</p>
<p>Far out in the blackness of space
McGuire and Sykes are captives in the
giant ship. Their stupor leaves them;
they find themselves immersed in
clouds. The clouds part; their ship
drops through; and below them is a
strange continent shaped like the letter
&ldquo;L.&rdquo; Captives of inhuman but man-shaped
things, they are landing upon
a strange globe&mdash;upon the planet
Venus itself!</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Miles</span> underneath the great
ship, from which Lieutenant
McGuire and Professor
Sykes were now watching
through a floor-window of thick glass,
was a glittering expanse of water&mdash;a
great ocean. The flickering gold expanse
that reflected back the color of
the sunlit clouds passed to one side
as the ship took its station above the
island, a continent in size, that had
shown by its shape like a sharply
formed &ldquo;L&rdquo; an identifying mark to the
astronomer.</p>
<p>They were high in the air; the thick
clouds that surrounded this new world
were miles from its surface, and the
things of the world that awaited were
tiny and blurred.</p>
<p>Airships passed and repassed far below.
Large, some of them&mdash;as bulky
as the transport they were on; others
were small flashing cylinders, but all
went swiftly on their way.</p>
<p>It must have come&mdash;some ethereal
vibration to warn others from the
path&mdash;for layer after layer of craft
were cleared for the descent. A brilliant
light flashed into view, a dazzling
pin-point on the shore below, and
the great ship fell suddenly beneath
them. Swiftly it dropped down the
pathway of light; on even keel it fell
down and still down, till McGuire, despite
his experience in the air, was sick
and giddy.</p>
<p>The light blinked out at their approach.
It was some minutes before
the watching eyes recovered from the
brilliance to see what mysteries might
await, and then the surface was close
and the range of vision small.</p>
<p>A vast open space&mdash;a great court
paved with blocks of black and white&mdash;a
landing field, perhaps, for about it
in regular spacing other huge cylinders
were moored. Directly beneath in
a clear space was a giant cradle of
curved arms; it was a mammoth structure,
and the men knew at a glance
that this was the bed where their great
ship would lie.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> smooth pavement seemed
slowly rising to meet them as
their ship settled close. Now the
cradle was below, its arms curved and
waiting. The ship entered their grasp,
and the arms widened, then closed to
draw the monster to its rest. Their
motion ceased. They were finally, beyond
the last faint doubt, at anchor
on a distant world.</p>
<p>A shrill cackle of sound recalled
them from the thrill of this adventure,
and the attenuated and lanky figure,
with its ashen, blotchy face that glared
at them from the doorway, reminded
them that this excursion into space was
none of their desire. They were prisoners&mdash;captives
from a foreign land.</p>
<p>A long hand moved its sinuous
fingers to motion them to follow, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
McGuire regarded his companion with
a hopeless look and a despondent
shrug of his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use putting up a fight,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d better be good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed where the figure was
stepping through a doorway into a
corridor beyond. They moved, silent
and depressed, along the dimly lighted
way; the touch of cold metal walls was
as chilling to their spirits as to their
flesh.</p>
<p>But the mood could not last: the
first ray of light from the outside
world sent shivers of anticipation
along their spines. They were landing,
in very fact, upon a new world; their
feet were to walk where never man
had stood; their eyes would see what
mortal eyes had never visioned.</p>
<p>Fears were forgotten, and the men
clung to each other not for the human
touch but because of an ecstasy of intoxicating,
soul-filling joy in the sheer
thrill of adventure.</p>
<p>They were gripping each other&rsquo;s
hand, round-eyed as a couple of children,
as they stepped forward into the
light.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Before</span> them was a scene whose
blazing beauty of color struck
them to frozen silence; their exclamations
of wonder died unspoken on
their lips. They were in a city of the
stars, and to their eyes it seemed as if
all the brilliance of the heavens had
been gathered for its building.</p>
<p>The spacious, open court itself stood
high in the air among the masses of
masonry, and beyond were countless
structures. Some towered skyward;
others were lower; and all were topped
with bulbous towers and graceful
minarets that made a forest of gleaming
opal light. Opalescence everywhere!&mdash;it
flashed in red and gold and
delicate blues from every wall and cornice
and roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quartz?&rdquo; marveled Sykes after one
long drawn breath. &ldquo;Quartz or glass?&mdash;what
are they made of? It is fairyland!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A jewelled city! Garish, it might
have been, and tawdry, in the full light
of the sun. But on these weirdly unreal
structures the sun&rsquo;s rays never
shone; they were illumined only by the
soft golden glow that diffused across
this world from the cloud masses far
above.</p>
<p>McGuire looked up at that uniform,
glowing, golden mass that paled toward
the horizon and faded to the gray
of banked clouds. His eyes came slowly
back to the ramp that led downward
to the checkered black and white of
the court. Beyond an open portion
the pavement was solidly massed with
people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People!&mdash;we might as well call
them that,&rdquo; McGuire had told Sykes;
&ldquo;they are people of a sort, I suppose.
We&rsquo;ll have to give them credit for
brains: they&rsquo;ve beaten us a hundred
years in their inventions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was trying to see everything, understand
everything, at once. There
was not time to single out the new
impressions that were crowding upon
him. The air&mdash;it was warm to the point
of discomfort; it explained the loose,
light garments of the people; it came
to the two men laden with strange
scents and stranger sounds.</p>
<p>McGuire&rsquo;s eyes held with hungry
curiosity upon the dwellers in this
other world; he stared at the gaping
throng from which came a bedlam of
shrill cries. Lean colorless hands gesticulated
wildly and pointed with long
fingers at the two men.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> din ceased abruptly at a sharp,
whistled order from their captor.
He stood aside with a guard that had
followed from the ship, and he motioned
the two before him down the
gangway. It was the same scarlet one
who had faced them before, the one
whom McGuire had attacked in a
frenzy of furious fighting, only to go
down to blackness and defeat before
the slim cylinder of steel and its hissing
gas. And the slanting eyes stared
wickedly in cold triumph as he ordered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
them to go before him in his
march of victory.</p>
<p>McGuire passed down toward the
masses of color that were the ones who
waited. There were many in the dull
red of the ship&rsquo;s crew; others in sky-blue,
in gold and pink and combinations
of brilliance that blended their
loose garments to kaleidoscopic hues.
But the figures were similar in one unvarying
respect: they were repulsive
and ghastly, and their faces showed
bright blotches of blood vessels and
blue markings of veins through their
parchment-gray skins.</p>
<p>The crowd parted to a narrow, living
lane, and lean fingers clutched writhingly
to touch them as they passed between
the solid ranks.</p>
<p>McGuire had only a vague impression
of a great building beyond, of
lower stories decorated in barbaric colors,
of towers above in strange forms
of the crystal, colorful beauty they
had seen. He walked toward it unseeing;
his thoughts were only of the
creatures round about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What damned beasts!&rdquo; he said.
Then, like his companion, he set his
teeth to restrain all show of feeling as
they made their way through the lane
of incredible living things.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>They</span> followed their captor
through a doorway into an empty
room&mdash;empty save for one blue-clad
individual who stood beside an instrument
board let into the wall. Beyond
was a long wall, where circular openings
yawned huge and black.</p>
<p>The one at the instrument panel received
a curt order: the weird voice
of the man in red repeated a word that
stood out above his curious, wordless
tone. &ldquo;Torg,&rdquo; he said, and again McGuire
heard him repeat the syllable.</p>
<p>The operator touched here and there
among his instruments, and tiny lights
flashed; he threw a switch, and from
one of the black openings like a deep
cave came a rushing roar of sound. It
dropped to silence as the end of a cylindrical
car protruded into the room.
A door in the metal car opened, and
their guard hustled them roughly inside.
The one in red followed while
behind him the door clanged shut.</p>
<p>Inside the car was light, a diffused
radiance from no apparent source, the
whole air was glowing about them.
And beneath their feet the car moved
slowly but with a constant acceleration
that built up to tremendous speed.
Then that slackened, and Sykes and
McGuire clung to each other for support
while the car that had been shot
like a projectile came to rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; breathed the lieutenant;
&ldquo;that was quick delivery.&rdquo; Sykes made
no reply, and McGuire, too, fell silent
to study the tremendous room into
which they were led. Here, seemingly,
was the stage for their next experience.</p>
<p>A vast open hall with a floor of glass
that was like obsidion, empty but for
carved benches about the walls; there
was room here for a mighty concourse
of people. The walls, like those they
had seen, were decorated crudely in
glaring colors, and embellished with
grotesque designs that proclaimed
loudly the inexpert touch of the
draughtsman. Yet, above them, the
ceiling sprang lightly into vaulted,
sweeping curves. McGuire&rsquo;s training
had held little of architecture, yet even
he felt the beauty of line and airy
gracefulness of treatment in the structure
itself.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> contrast between the flaunting
colors and the finished artistry
that lay beneath must have struck a
discordant note to the scientist. He
leaned closer to whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all wrong some way&mdash;the
whole world! Beauty and refinement&mdash;then
crude vulgarity, as incongruous
as the people themselves&mdash;they do not
belong here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do we,&rdquo; was McGuire&rsquo;s
reply; &ldquo;it looks like a tough spot that
we&rsquo;re in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was watching toward a high,
arched entrance across the room. A
platform before it was raised some six
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
feet above the floor, and on this were
seats&mdash;ornate chairs, done in sweeping
scrolls of scarlet and gold. A massive
seat in the center was like the fantastic
throne of a child&rsquo;s fairy tale. From
the corridor beyond that entrance
came a stir and rustling that rivetted
the man&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>A trumpet peal, vibrant and peculiar,
blared forth from the ceiling overhead,
and the red figures of the guards stood
at rigid attention with lean arms held
stiffly before them. The one in scarlet
took the same attitude, then dropped
his hands to motion the two men to
give the same salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go to hell,&rdquo; said Lieutenant
McGuire in his gentlest tones. And
the scarlet figure&rsquo;s thin lips were snarling
as he turned to whip his arms up
to their position. The first of a procession
of figures was entering through
the arch.</p>
<p>Sykes, the scientist, was paying
little attention. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; he was
muttering aloud; &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be true.
Venus! Twenty-six million miles at
inferior conjunction!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed lost in silent communion
with his own thoughts; then: &ldquo;But I
said there was every probability of
life; I pointed out the similarities&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; warned McGuire. The eyes
of the scarlet man were sending
wicked looks in their direction. Tall
forms were advancing through the
arch. They, too, were robed in scarlet,
and behind them others followed.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> trumpet peal from the dome
above held now on a long-drawn,
single note, while the scarlet men
strode in silence across the dais and
parted to form two lines. An inverted
&ldquo;V&rdquo; that faced the entrance&mdash;they
were an assembly of rigid, blazing
statues whose arms were extended
like those on the floor below.</p>
<p>The vibrant tone from on high
changed to a crashing blare that
shrieked discordantly to send quivering
protest through every nerve of the
waiting men. Those about them were
shouting, and again the name of Torg
was heard, as, in the high arch, another
character appeared to play his part in
a strange drama.</p>
<p>Thin like his companions, yet even
taller than them, he wore the same brilliant
robes and, an additional mark of
distinction, a head-dress of polished
gold. He acknowledged the salute with
a quick raising of his own arms, then
came swiftly forward and took his
place upon the massive throne.</p>
<p>Not till he was seated did the others
on the platform relax their rigid pose
and seat themselves in the semicircle
of chairs. And not till then did they
so much as glance at the men waiting
there before them&mdash;the two Earth-men,
standing in silent, impassive contemplation
of the brilliant scene and with
their arms held quiet at their sides.
Then every eye turned full upon the
captives, and if McGuire had seen
deadly malevolence in the face of their
captor he found it a hundred-fold in
the inhuman faces that looked down
upon them now.</p>
<p>The inquiring mind of Professor
Sykes did not fail to note the character
of their reception. &ldquo;But why,&rdquo; he
asked in whispers of his fellow-prisoner,
&ldquo;&mdash;why this open hatred of us?
What possible animus can they have
against the earth or its people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure on the throne voiced a
curt order; the one who had brought
them stepped forward. His voice was
raised in the same discordant, singing
tone that leaped and wandered from
note to note. It conveyed ideas&mdash;that
was apparent; it was a language that
he spoke. And the central figure above
nodded a brief assent as he finished.</p>
<p>Their captor took an arm of each in
his long fingers and pushed them
roughly forward to stand alone before
the battery of hard eyes.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Now</span> the crowned figure addressed
them directly. His voice quavered
sharply in what seemed an interrogation.
The men looked blankly at
each other.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></div>
<p>Again the voice questioned them impatiently.
Sykes and McGuire were
silent. Then the young flyer took an
involuntary step forward and looked
squarely at the owner of the harsh
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what you are saying,&rdquo;
he began, &ldquo;and I suppose that
our lingo makes no sense to you&mdash;&rdquo;
He paused in helpless wonderment as
to what he could say. Then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what the devil is it all about?&rdquo;
he demanded explosively. &ldquo;Why all
the dirty looks? You&rsquo;ve got us here as
prisoners&mdash;now what do you expect us
to do? Whatever it is, you&rsquo;ll have to
quit singing it and talk something we
can understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew his words were useless, but
this reception was getting on his
nerves&mdash;and his arm still tingled
where the scarlet one had gripped him.</p>
<p>It seemed, though, that his meaning
was not entirely lost. His words meant
nothing to them, but his tone must
have carried its own message. There
were sharp exclamations from the
seated circle. The one who had brought
them sprang forward with outstretched,
clutching hands; his face
was a blood-red blotch. McGuire was
waiting in crouching tenseness that
made the red one pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You touch me again,&rdquo; said the waiting
man, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll knock you into an
outside loop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attacker&rsquo;s indecision was ended
by a loud order from above. McGuire
turned as if he had been spoken to by
the leader on the throne. The thin
figure was leaning far forward; his
eye were boring into those of the lieutenant,
and he held the motionless pose
for many minutes. To the angry man,
staring back and upward, there came a
peculiar optical illusion.</p>
<p>The evil face was vanishing in a
shifting cloud that dissolved and reformed,
as he watched, into pictures.
He knew it was not there, the thing he
saw; he knew he was regarding something
as intangible as thought; but he
got the significance of every detail.</p>
<p>He saw himself and Professor
Sykes; they were being crushed like
ants beneath a tremendous heel; he
knew that the foot that could grind
out their lives was that of the one on
the throne.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> cloud-stuff melted to new
forms that grew clearer to show
him the earth. A distorted Earth&mdash;and
he knew the distortion came from the
mind of the being before him who had
never seen the earth at first hand; yet
he knew it for his own world. It was
turning in space; he saw oceans and
continents; and before his mental gaze
he saw the land swarming with these
creatures of Venus. The one before
him was in command; he was seated
on an enormous throne; there were
Earth people like Sykes and himself
who crept humbly before him, while
fleets of great Venusian ships hovered
overhead.</p>
<p>The message was plain&mdash;plain as if
written in words of fire in the brain of
the man. McGuire knew that these
creatures intended that the vision
should be true&mdash;they meant to conquer
the earth. The slim, khaki-clad figure
of Lieutenant McGuire quivered with
the strength of his refusal to accept
the truth of what he saw. He shook
his head to clear it of these thought
wraiths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;in&mdash;a&mdash;million&mdash;years!&rdquo; he
said, and he put behind his words all
the mental force at his command. &ldquo;Try
that, old top, and they&rsquo;ll give you the
fight of your life&mdash;&rdquo; He checked his
words as he saw plainly that the thin
cruel face that stared and stared was
getting nothing from his reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what do you think about
that?&rdquo; he demanded of Professor
Sykes. &ldquo;He got an idea across to me&mdash;some
form of telepathy. I saw his
mind, or I saw what he wanted me to
see of it. It&rsquo;s taps, he says, for us, and
then they think they&rsquo;re going across
and annex the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced upward again and
laughed loudly for the benefit of those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
who were watching him so closely.
&ldquo;Fine chance!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;a fat chance!&rdquo;
But in the deeper recesses of his mind
he was shaken.</p>
<p>For themselves there was no hope.
Well, that was all in a lifetime. But
the other&mdash;the conquest of the earth&mdash;he
had to try with all his power of will
to keep from his mind the pictures of
destruction these beastly things could
bring about.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> chief of this strange council
made a gesture of contempt with
the grotesque hands that were so translucent
yet ashy-pale against his scarlet
robe, and the down-drawn thin lips
reflected the thoughts that prompted
it. The open opposition of Lieutenant
McGuire failed to impress him, it
seemed. At a word the one who had
brought them sprang forward.</p>
<p>He addressed himself to the circle
of men, and he harangued them mightily
in harsh discordance. He pointed
one lean hand at the two captives,
then beat it upon his own chest. &ldquo;They
are mine,&rdquo; he was saying, as the men
knew plainly. And they realized as if
the weird talk came like words to their
ears that this monster was demanding
that the captives be given him.</p>
<p>An exchange of dismayed glances,
and &ldquo;Not so good!&rdquo; said McGuire under
his breath; &ldquo;Simon Legree is asking
for his slaves. Mean, ugly devil,
that boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lean figures on the platform
were bending forward, an expression
of mirth&mdash;distorted, animal smiles&mdash;upon
their flabby lips. They represented
to the humans, so helpless before
them, a race of thinking things in
whom no last vestige of kindness or
decency remained. But was there an
exception? One of the circle was
standing; the one beside them was sullenly
silent as the other on the platform
addressed their ruler.</p>
<p>He spoke at some length, not with
the fire and vehemence of the one who
had claimed them, but more quietly
and dispassionately, and his cold eyes,
when they rested on those of McGuire
and Sykes, seemed more crafty than
actively ablaze with malevolent ill-will.
Plainly it was the councilor now, addressing
his superior. His inhuman
voice was silenced by a reply from the
one on the throne.</p>
<p>He motioned&mdash;this gold-crowned
figure of personified evil&mdash;toward the
two men, and his hand swept on toward
the one who had spoken. He intoned
a command in harsh gutturals
that ended in a sibilant shriek. And
the two standing silent and hopeless
exchanged looks of despair.</p>
<p>They were being delivered to this
other&mdash;that much was plain&mdash;but that
it boded anything but captivity and
torment they could not believe. That
last phrase was too eloquent of hissing
hate.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> creature rose, tall and ungainly,
from his throne; amid the
salutations of his followers he turned
and vanished through the arch. The
others of his council followed, all but
the one. He motioned to the two men
to come with him, and the sullen one
who had demanded the men for himself
obeyed an order from this councilor
who was his superior.</p>
<p>He snapped an order, and four of his
men ranged themselves about the captives
as a guard. Thin metal cords
were whipped about the wrists of each;
their hands were tied. The wire cut
like a knife-edge if they strained
against it.</p>
<p>The new director of their destinies
was vanishing through an exit at one
side of the great hall; their guard
hustled them after. A corridor opened
before them to end in a gold-lit portal;
it was daylight out beyond where a
street was filled with hurrying figures
in many colors. With quavering
shrieks they scattered like frightened
fowls as an airship descended between
the tall buildings that reflected its
passing in opalescent hues.</p>
<p>It was a small craft compared with
the one that had brought them, and it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
swept down to settle lightly upon the
street with no least regard for those
who might be crushed by its descent.
Consideration for their fellows did not
appear as a marked characteristic of
this strange people, McGuire observed
thoughtfully. They swarmed in endless
droves, these multicolored beings
who made of the thoroughfare an ever-changing
kaleidoscope&mdash;and what was
a life or two, more or less, among so
many? He found no comfort for themselves
in the thought.</p>
<p>Shoulder to shoulder, the two followed
where the scarlet figure of the
councilor moved toward the waiting
ship. Only the professor paid further
heed to their surroundings; he marveled
aloud at the numbers of the
people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hundreds of them,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;thousands!
They are swarming everywhere
like rats. Horrible!&rdquo; His eyes passed
on to the buildings in their glory of
delicate hues, as he added, &ldquo;And the
contrast they make with their surroundings!
It is all wrong some way;
I wish I knew&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were in the ship when McGuire
replied. &ldquo;I hope we live long
enough to satisfy your curiosity,&rdquo; he
said grimly.</p>
<p>The ship was rising beneath them;
the opal and quartz of the city&rsquo;s walls
were flashing swiftly down.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>They</span> were in a cabin at the very
nose of the ship, seated on metal
chairs, their hands unshackled and
free. Their scarlet guardian reclined
at ease somewhat to one side, but despite
his apparent disregard his cold
eyes seldom left the faces of the two
men.</p>
<p>Windows closed them in; windows
on each side, in front, above them, and
even in the floor beneath. It was a
room for observation whose metal-latticed
walls served only as a framework
for the glass. And there was
much to be observed.</p>
<p>The golden radiance of sunlit clouds
was warm above. They rose toward it,
until, high over the buildings&rsquo; tallest
spires, there spread on every hand the
bewildering beauty of that forest of
minarets and sloping roofs and towers,
whose many facets made glorious
blendings of soft color. Aircraft at
many levels swept in uniform directions
throughout the sky. The ship
they were in hung quiet for a time,
then rose to a higher level to join the
current of transportation that flowed
into the south.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will call it south,&rdquo; said Professor
Sykes. &ldquo;The sun-glow, you will
observe, is not directly overhead; the
sun is sinking; it is past their noon.
What is the length of their day? Ah,
this interesting&mdash;interesting!&rdquo; The
certain fate they had foreseen was forgotten;
it is not often given to an astronomer
to check at first hand his
own indefinite observations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; McGuire exclaimed. &ldquo;Open
country! The city is ending!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Ahead</span> and below them the buildings
were smaller and scattered.
Their new master was watching with
closest scrutiny the excitement of the
men; he whispered an order into a
nearby tube, and the ship slowly
slanted toward the ground. He was
studying these new specimens, as McGuire
observed, but the lieutenant paid
little attention; his eyes were too thoroughly
occupied in resolving into recognizable
units the picture that flowed
past them so quickly. He was accustomed,
this pilot of the army air service,
to reading clearly the map that
spreads beneath a plane, but now he
was looking at an unfamiliar chart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fields,&rdquo; he said, and pointed to
squared areas of pale reds and blues;
&ldquo;though what it is, heaven knows. And
the trees!&mdash;if that&rsquo;s what they are.&rdquo;
The ship went downward where an
area of tropical denseness made a
tangled mass of color and shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trees!&rdquo; Lieutenant McGuire had
exclaimed, but these forests were of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
tree-forms in weirdest shapes and hues.
They grew to towering heights, and
their branches and leaves that swayed
and dipped in the slow-moving air
were of delicate pastel shades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sunlight,&rdquo; said the Professor excitedly;
&ldquo;they have no direct rays of
the sun. The clouds act as a screen
and filter out actinic rays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McGuire did not reply. He was
watching the countless dots of color
that were people&mdash;people who swarmed
here as they had in the city; people
working at these great groves, crouching
lower in the fields as the ship
swept close; people everywhere in
teeming thousands. And like the vegetation
about them, they, too, were tall
and thin, attenuated of form and with
skin like blood-stained ash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They need the sun,&rdquo; Sykes was repeating;
&ldquo;both vegetable and animal
life. The plants are deficient in chlorophyl&mdash;see
the pale green of the
leaves!&mdash;and the people need vitamins.
Yet they evidently have electric
power in abundance. I could tell
them of lamps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>His</span> comments ceased as McGuire
lurched heavily against him.
The flyer had taken note of the tense,
attentive attitude of the one in scarlet;
the man was leaning forward, his eyes
focused directly upon the scientist&rsquo;s
face; he seemed absorbing both words
and emotions.</p>
<p>How much could he comprehend?
What power had he to vision the idea-pictures
in the other&rsquo;s mind? McGuire
could not know. But &ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; he told
Sykes; &ldquo;that was clumsy of me.&rdquo; And
he added in a whisper, &ldquo;Keep your
thoughts to yourself; I think this bird
is getting them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buildings flashed under them, not
massed solidly as in the city, yet
spaced close to one another as if every
foot of ground not devoted to their
incredible agriculture were needed to
house the inhabitants. The ground
about them was alive with an equally
incredible humanity that swarmed over
all this world in appalling profusion.</p>
<p>Their horrid flesh! Their hideous
features! And their number! McGuire
had a sudden, sickening thought.
They were larvae, these crawling
hordes&mdash;vile worm-things that infested
a beautiful world&mdash;that bred here in
millions, their numbers limited only
by the space for their bodies and the
food for their stomachs. And he, McGuire,
a <i>man</i>&mdash;he and this other man
with his clear-thinking scientific brain
were prisoners to this horde; captives,
to be used or butchered by those vile,
crawling things!</p>
<p>And again it was this world of contrast
that drove home the conviction
with its sickening certainty. A world
of beauty, of delicate colors, of sweeping
oceans and gleaming shores and
towering cities with their grace and
beauty and elfin splendor yet a world
that shuddered beneath this devouring
plague of grublike men.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>They</span> swept past cities and towns
and over many miles of open land
before their craft swung eastward toward
the dark horizon. The master
gave another order into the speaking
tube and their ship shot forward, faster
and yet faster, with a speed that
pressed them heavily into their seats.
Behind them was the glory of the sunlit
clouds; ahead the gloomy gray-black
masses that must make a stygian
night sky over this lonely world&mdash;a
world cut off by that vaporous shell
from all communion with the stars.</p>
<p>They were over the water; before
them a dark ocean reached out in forbidding
emptiness to a darker horizon.
Ahead, the only broken line in the vast
level expanse was a mountain rising
abruptly from the sea. It was a volcanic
cone surmounting an island; the
sunlight&rsquo;s glow reflected from behind
them against the sombre mass that
lifted toward the clouds. Their ship
was high enough to clear it, but instead
it swung, as McGuire watched,
toward the south.</p>
<p>The island drifted past, and again
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
they were on their course. But to the
flyer there were significant facts that
could not pass unobserved. Their own
ship had swung in a great circle to
avoid this mountain. And all through
the skies were others that did the same.
The air above and about the grim sentinel
peak was devoid of flying shapes.</p>
<p>McGuire caught the eyes of the
councilor, their keeper. &ldquo;What is
that?&rdquo; he asked, though he knew the
words were lost on the other. He nodded
his head toward the distant peak,
and his question was plainly in regard
to the island. And for the first time
since their coming to this wild world,
he saw, flashing across the features of
one of these men, a trace of emotion
that could only be construed as fear.</p>
<p>The slitted cat eyes lost their look
of complacent superiority. They
widened involuntarily, and the face
was drained of its blotched color.
There was fear, terror unmistakable,
though it showed for but an instant.
He had control of his features almost
at once, but the flyer had read their
story.</p>
<p>Here was something that gave pause
to this race of conquering vermin; a
place in the expanse of this vast sea
that brought panic to their hearts. And
there came to him, as he stowed the
remembrance away in his mind, the
first glow of hope. These things could
fear a mountain; it might be that they
could be brought to fear a man.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> sky was clearing rapidly of
traffic and the mountain of his
speculations was lost astern, when another
island came slanting swiftly up
to meet them as their ship swept down
from the heights. It was a tiny speck
in the ocean&rsquo;s expanse, a speck that resolved
itself into the squared fields of
colored growth, orchards whose brilliant,
strange fruits glowed crimson in
the last light of day, and enormous
trees, beyond which appeared a house.</p>
<p>A palace, McGuire concluded, when
he saw clearly the many-storied pile.
Like the buildings they had seen, this
also constructed of opalescent quartz.
There were windows that glowed
warmly in the dusk. A sudden wave
of loneliness, almost unbearable, swept
over the man.</p>
<p>Windows and gleaming lights, the
good sounds of Earth; home!... And
his ears, as he stepped out into the cool
air, were assailed with the strange
cackle and calling of weird folk; the
air brought him scents, from the open
ground beyond, of fruits and vegetation
like none he had ever known; and
the earth, the homeland of his vain imaginings,
was millions of empty miles
away....</p>
<p>The leader stopped, and McGuire
looked dispiritedly at the unfamiliar
landscape under dusky lowering skies.
Trees towered high in the air&mdash;trees
grotesque and weird by all Earth
standards&mdash;whose limbs were pale
green shadows in the last light of day.
The foliage, too, seemed bleached and
drained of color, but among the leaves
were flashes of brilliance where night-blooming
flowers burst open like star-shells
to fill the air with heavy scents.</p>
<p>Between the men and the forest
growth was a row of denser vegetation,
great ferns twenty feet and more in
height, and among them at regular intervals
stood plants of another growth&mdash;each
a tremendous pod held in air on
a thick stalk. Tendrils coiled themselves
like giant springs beside each
pod, tendrils as thick as a man&rsquo;s wrist.
The great pods were ranged in a line
that extended as far as McGuire could
see in the dim light.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>His</span> shoulders drooped as the
guard herded him and his companion
toward the building beyond. He
must not be cast down&mdash;he would not!
Who knew how much of such feeling
was read by these keen-eyed observers?
And the only thought with
which he could fill his mind, the one
forlorn ghost of a hope that he could
cling to, was that of an island, a volcanic
peak that rose from dark waters
to point upward toward the heights.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></div>
<p>The guard of four was clustered
about; the figures were waiting now in
the gathering dark&mdash;waiting, while the
one in scarlet listened and spoke alternately
into a jeweled instrument that
hung by a slender chain about his neck.
He raised one lean hand to motion the
stirring guards to silence, listened
again intently into the instrument,
then pointed that hand toward the
cloud-filled sky, while he craned his
thin neck to look above him.</p>
<p>The men&rsquo;s eyes followed the pointing
hand to see only the sullen black
of unlit clouds. The last distant aircraft
had vanished from the skies; not
a ship was in the air&mdash;only the enveloping
blanket of high-flung vapor that
blocked out all traces of the heavens.
And then!&mdash;</p>
<p>The cloud banks high in the skies
flashed suddenly to dazzling, rolling
flame. The ground under their feet
was shaken as by a distant earthquake,
while, above, the terrible fire spread, a
swift, flashing conflagration that ate
up the masses of clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in thunder&mdash;&rdquo; McGuire began;
then stopped as he caught, in the
light from above, the reflection of
fierce exultation in the eyes of the
scarlet one. The evil, gloating message
of those eyes needed no words to
explain its meaning. That this cataclysm
was self-made by these beings,
McGuire knew, and he knew that in
some way it meant menace to him and
his.</p>
<p>Yet he groped in thought for some
definite meaning. No menace could
this be to himself personally, for he
and Sykes stood there safe in the company
of the councilor himself. Then
the threat of this flaming blast must be
directed toward the earth!</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> fire vanished, and once more,
as Professor Sykes had seen on
that night so long ago, the blanket of
clouds was broken. McGuire followed
the gaze of the scientist whose keen
eyes were probing in these brief moments
into the depths of star-lit space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;there!&rdquo; Sykes exclaimed in
awe-struck tones. His hand was pointing
outward through the space where
flames had cleared the sky. A star
was shining in the heavens with a
glory that surpassed all others. It outshone
all neighboring stars, and it sent
its light down through the vast empty
reaches of space, a silent message to
two humans, despondent and heartsick,
who stared with aching eyes.</p>
<p>Lieutenant McGuire did not hear his
friend&rsquo;s whispered words. No need to
name that distant world&mdash;it was Earth!
Earth!... And it was calling to its
own....</p>
<p>There was a flying-field&mdash;so plain before
his mental eyes; men in khaki and
leather who moved and talked and
spoke of familiar things ... and the
thunder of motors ... and roaring
planes....</p>
<p>Some far recess within his deeper
self responded strangely. What now
of threats and these brute-things that
threatened?&mdash;he was one with this picture
he had visioned. He was himself;
he was a man of that distant world of
men; they would show these vile
things how men could meet menace&mdash;or
death.... His shoulders were
back and unconsciously he stood erect.</p>
<p>The scarlet figure was close beside
them in the dusk, his voice vibrant
with a quality which should have
struck fear to his captives&rsquo; hearts as he
ordered them on. But the look in his
crafty eyes changed to one of puzzled
wonder at sight of the men.</p>
<p>Hands on each other&rsquo;s shoulders,
they stood there in the gathering dark,
where grotesque trees arched twistingly
overhead. Their moment of depression
had passed; Earth had called, and
they had heard it, each after his own
fashion. But to each the call had been
one of clear courage. No longer cast
off and forlorn, they were one with
their own world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down,&rdquo; said Professor Sykes with
a whimsical smile; &ldquo;down, but not
out!&rdquo; And the lieutenant responded
in kind.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Are we down-hearted?&rdquo; he demanded
loudly. And the two turned
as one man to grin at the scarlet one
as they thundered. &ldquo;N-o-o!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Two</span> men grinned in derision at
the horrible, man-shaped thing
that held their destinies in his lean,
inhuman hands!&mdash;but they turned
abruptly away to look again above
them where that bright star still shone
through an opening in the clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The earth! Home!&rdquo; It seemed as
if they could never tear their eyes
away from the sight.</p>
<p>Their captor whistled an order, and
the guard of four tugged vainly at the
two, who resisted that they might gaze
upon their own world until the closing
clouds should blot it from sight. A
cry from one of the red guards roused
them.</p>
<p>The dark was closing in fast, and
their surroundings were dim. Vaguely,
McGuire felt more than saw one of the
red figures whirled into the air. He
sensed a movement in the jungle darkness
where were groves of weird trees
and the tangle of huge vegetable
growths. What it was he could not
say, but he felt the guard who clutched
at him quiver in terror.</p>
<p>Their leader snatched at the instrument
that hung about his neck and put
it to his lips; he whistled an order,
sharp and shrill. Blazing light that
seemed to flame in the air was the response;
the air was aglow with an all-pervading
brilliance like that in the
car that had whirled them from the
landing field. The light was everywhere,
and the building before them
was surrounded by a dazzling envelope
of luminosity.</p>
<p>Whatever of motion or menace there
had been ceased abruptly. Their guard,
three now in number instead of four,
seized them roughly and hustled them
toward an open door. No time, as they
passed, for more than fleeting impressions:
a hall of warm, glowing light&mdash;a
passage that branched off&mdash;and, at
the end, a room into which they were
thrown, while a metal door clanged
behind them.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>These</span> were no gentle hands that
hurled the men staggering through
the doorway, and Professor Sykes fell
headlong upon the glassy floor. He
sprang to his feet, his face aflame with
anger. &ldquo;The miserable beasts!&rdquo; he
shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy,&rdquo; admonished the flyer.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the hoose-gow; no use of
getting all fussed up if they don&rsquo;t behave
like perfect gentlemen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bunk in the corner,&rdquo; he
said, and pointed to a woven hammock
that was covered with soft cloths; &ldquo;and
here&rsquo;s another that I can sling. Twin
beds! What more do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened a door and the splash of
falling water came to them. A fountain
cascaded to the ceiling to fall
splashing upon a floor of inlaid, glassy
tile. McGuire whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Room and bath,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And you
complained of the service!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; he told the scientist,
&ldquo;that our scarlet friend who owns
this place intends to treat us decently,
even though his helpers are a bit rough.
My hunch is that he wants to get some
information out of us. That old bird
back there in the council chamber told
me as plain as day that they think they
are going to conquer the earth. Maybe
that&rsquo;s why we are here&mdash;as exhibits
A and B, for them to study and learn
how to lick us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are talking what I would have
termed nonsense a month ago,&rdquo; replied
Sykes, &ldquo;but now&mdash;well, I am afraid you
are right. And,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I
fear that they are equally correct.
They have conquered space; they have
ships propelled by some unknown
power; they have gas weapons, as you
and I have reason to know. And they
have all the beastly ferocity to carry
such a plan through to success. But
I wonder what that sky-splitting blast
meant.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Bombardment,&rdquo; the flyer told him;
&ldquo;bombardment of the earth as sure as
you&rsquo;re alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More nonsense,&rdquo; said Sykes; &ldquo;and
probably correct.... Well, what are
we to do?&mdash;sit tight and give them as
little information as we can? or&mdash;&rdquo;
His question ended unfinished; the
alternative, it seemed, was not plain to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one answer,&rdquo; said McGuire.
&ldquo;We must get away; escape
somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Professor Sykes&rsquo;</span> eyes showed
his appreciation of a spirit that
could still dare to hope, but he asked
dejectedly: &ldquo;Escape? Good idea. But
where to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; the flyer said
slowly. &ldquo;An idea about an island.&rdquo; He
told the professor what he had observed&mdash;the
fact that there was one
spot of land on this globe from which
the traffic of these monsters of Venus
steered clear. This, he explained, must
have some significance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is there, God only
knows,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but it is something
these devils don&rsquo;t like a little bit.
It might be interesting to learn more.
We&rsquo;ll make a break for it; find a boat.
No, we probably can&rsquo;t do it, but we can
make a try. Now what is our first
step, I wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our first step,&rdquo; said Professor Sykes,
measuring his words as if he might be
working out some astronomical calculation,
&ldquo;is into the inverted shower-bath,
if you feel as hot as I do. And
our next step, when all is quiet for the
night, is through the window I see beyond.
I can see the branches of one of
those undernourished trees from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last one in is a lop-eared Venusian!&rdquo;
said McGuire, throwing off his
jacket. And in that strange room in
a strange world, under the shadow of
death and of tortures unknown, the
two men stripped with all the care-free
abandon of a couple of schoolboys
racing to be first in the old swimming
hole.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>It</span> was some time later when the door
opened and a long red hand pushed
a tray of food into the room. The
tray was of unbreakable crystal&mdash;he
rattled it heedlessly upon the floor&mdash;and
it held crystal dishes of unknown
foods.</p>
<p>They were sampling them all when
Sykes remarked plaintively, &ldquo;I would
like to know what under heaven I am
eating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wished to know that in lots of
restaurants,&rdquo; McGuire replied. &ldquo;I
remember a place down on&mdash;&rdquo; He
stopped abruptly, then chewed in
silence upon a fruit like a striped pepper
that stung his mouth and tongue
while he scarcely felt it. References
to Earth things plainly were to be
avoided: the visions they brought before
one&rsquo;s eyes were unnerving.</p>
<p>They made a pretence of sleeping in
case they were being observed, and it
was some hours later when the two
stood quietly beside the open window.
As Sykes had seen, there were branches
of a pale, twisted tree-growth close
outside. McGuire tried his weight
upon them, then swung himself out,
hand over hand, upon the branch that
bent low beneath him. Sykes was close
behind when he clambered to the
ground to stand for some minutes,
listening silently in the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too easy!&rdquo; the lieutenant whispered.
&ldquo;They are too foxy to leave a
gateway like that&mdash;but here we are.
The shore is off in this direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dark of a night unrelieved by a
single star was about them as they
moved noiselessly away. They followed
open ground at first. The building
that had been their brief prison
was upon their right; beyond and at
the left was where the ship landed&mdash;it
was gone now&mdash;and beyond that the
wall of vegetation.</p>
<p>And again, in the dark, McGuire had
an uncanny sense of motion. Soft
bodies were slipping quietly one upon
another; something that lived was
there beyond them in the night. No
sound or sign of life came from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
house; no guard had been posted; and
McGuire stopped again, before plunging
into the tangled growth, to whisper,
&ldquo;Too easy, Sykes! There&rsquo;s something
about this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>He</span> had pushed aside the fronds
of a giant fern; a cautious step
beyond his hands touched a slippery,
pliant vine. And his whisper ended as
he felt the thing turn and twist beneath
his hand. It was alive!&mdash;writhing!&mdash;cold
as the body of a monster
snake, and just as vicious and savage
in the way that it whipped down and
about him in the gloom of the starless
night.</p>
<p>The thing was alive! It threw its
coils around his body in an embrace
that left him breathless; a slender
tendril was tightening about his neck;
his hands and arms were bound.</p>
<p>His ankle was grasped as he was
whirled aloft&mdash;a human hand that
gripped him this time&mdash;and Sykes, forgetting
discretion and the need for
silence, was shouting in the darkness
that gave no clue to their opponent.
&ldquo;Hang on!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you,
Mac!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His shouts were cut short by another
serpent shape that thrashed him and
smashed the softer growing things to
earth that it might wrap this man, too,
in its deadly coils.</p>
<p>McGuire felt his companion&rsquo;s hold
loosen as he was lifted from the
ground; there were other arms flailing
about him&mdash;living, coiling things that
seemed to fight one with another for
this prize. Abruptly, blindingly, the
scene was vividly etched before him:
the strange trees, the ferns, the writhing
and darting serpent-arms! They
were illumined in a dazzling, white
light!</p>
<p>He was in the air, clutched strangely
in constricting arms; an odor of rotted
flesh was in his nostrils, sickening,
suffocating! Beyond and almost beneath
him a cauldron of green gaped
open, and he saw within it a pool of
thick liquid that eddied and steamed
to give off the stench of putrescence.</p>
<p>All this in an instant of vision&mdash;and
in that instant he knew the death they
courted. It was a giant pod that held
that pool&mdash;one of the growths he had
seen ranged out like a line of sentinels.
But the terrible tendrils that had been
coiled and at rest were wrapped about
him now, drawing him to that reeking
pool of death and the waiting thick
lips that would close above him. Sykes,
too! The tendrils that had clutched
him were whisking his helpless body
where another gaping mouth was
open&mdash;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>And</span> then, in the blazing light that
was more brilliant than any light
of day in this world, the hold about
McGuire relaxed. He saw, as he fell,
the thick, green lips snap shut; and the
arms that had held him pulled back
into harmless, tight-wound coils.</p>
<p>Their bodies crashed to earth where
a great fern bent beneath them
to cushion their fall. And the men lay
silent and gasping for great choking
breaths, while from the building beyond
came the cackle and shrieking of
man-things in manifest enjoyment of
the frustrated plans.</p>
<p>It was the laughter that determined
McGuire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn the plants!&rdquo; he said between
hoarse breaths. &ldquo;Man-eating plants&mdash;but
they&rsquo;re&mdash;better&mdash;than&mdash;those
devils! And there&rsquo;s only&mdash;one line of
them: I saw them here before. Shall
we go on?&mdash;make a break for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sykes rolled to the shelter of an
arching frond and, without a word,
went crawling away. McGuire was behind
him, and the two, as they came to
open ground, sprang to their feet and
ran on through the weird orchard
where tree trunks made dim, twisting
lines. They ran blindly and helplessly
toward the outer dark that promised
temporary shelter.</p>
<p>A hopeless attempt: both men, knew
the futility of it, while they stumbled
onward through the dark. Behind
them the night was hideous with noise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
as the great palace gave forth an
eruption of shrieking, inhuman forms
that scattered with whistling and wailing
calls in all directions.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>A mile</span> or more of groping, hopeless
flight, till a yellow gleam
shone among the trees to guide them.
A building, beyond a clearing, gave a
bright illumination to the black night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve run in a circle,&rdquo; choked McGuire,
his voice weak and uncertain
with exhaustion. &ldquo;Like a couple of
fools!&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited until the heavy breathing
that shook his body might be controlled,
then corrected himself. &ldquo;No&mdash;this
is another&mdash;a new one&mdash;see the
towers! And listen&mdash;it&rsquo;s a radio station!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slender frameworks that towered
high in air glowed like flame&mdash;a
warning to the ships whose lights
showed now and then far overhead.
And, clear and distinct, there came to
the listening men the steady, crackling
hiss of an uninterrupted signal.</p>
<p>Against the lighted building moving
figures showed momentarily, and McGuire
pulled his friend into the safe
concealment of a tangle of growth,
while the group of yelling things sped
past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he told Sykes; &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t
get away&mdash;not a chance! Let&rsquo;s have a
look at this place, and perhaps&mdash;well,
I have an idea!&rdquo; He slipped silently,
cautiously on, where a forest of jungle
ferns gave promise of safe passage.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Some</span> warning had been sounded;
the occupants of the building
were scattered to aid in the man-hunt.
Only one was left in the room where
two Earth-men peeped in at the door.</p>
<p>The figure was seated upon an insulated
platform, and his long hands
manipulated keys and levers on a table
before him. McGuire and Sykes stared
amazedly at this broadcasting station
whose air was filled with a pandemonium
of crashing sound from some
distant room, but McGuire was concerned
mainly with the motion of a
lean, blood-red hand that swung an object
like a pointer in free-running
sweeps above a dial on the table. And
he detected a variation in the din from
beyond as the pointer moved swiftly.</p>
<p>Here was the control board for those
messages he had heard; this was the
instrument that varied the sending
mechanism to produce the wailing
wireless cries that made words in some
far-distant ears. McGuire, as he
slipped into the room and crept within
leaping distance of the grotesque thing
so like yet unlike a man, was as silent
as the nameless, writhing horror that
had seized them in the dark. He
sprang, and the two came crashing to
the floor.</p>
<p>Lean arms came quickly about him
to clutch and tear at his face, but the
flyer had an arm free, and one blow
ended the battle. The man of Venus
relaxed to a huddle of purple and yellow
cloth from which a ghastly face
protruded. McGuire leaped to his feet
and sprang to the place where the other
had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold them off as long as you can!&rdquo;
he shouted to Sykes, and his hand
closed upon the pointer.</p>
<p>Did this station send where he was
hoping? Was this the station that had
communicated with the ship that had
hovered above their flying field in that
far-off land? He did not know, but it
was a powerful station, and there was
a chance&mdash;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>He</span> moved the pointer frantically
here and there, swung it to one
side and another; then found at last
a point on the outside of the strange
design beneath his hand where the
pointer could rest while the crashing
crackle of sound was stilled.</p>
<p>And now he swung the pointer&mdash;upon
the plate&mdash;anywhere!&mdash;and the
noise from beyond told instantly of
the current&rsquo;s passage. He held it an
instant, then pushed it back to the
silent spot&mdash;a dash! A quick return
that flashed back again to bring silence&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
dot! More dashes and dots ... and
McGuire thanked a kindly heaven that
had permitted him to learn the
language of the air, while he cursed his
slowness in sending.</p>
<p>Would it reach? Would there be
anyone to hear? No certainty; he
could only flash the wild Morse symbols
out into the night. He must try
to get word to them&mdash;warn them! And
&ldquo;Blake,&rdquo; he called, and spelled out the
name of their field, &ldquo;warning&mdash;Venus&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold them!&rdquo; he yelled to Sykes at
the sound of rushing feet. &ldquo;Keep them
off as long as you can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;... Prepare&mdash;for invasion. Blake,
this is McGuire....&rdquo; Over and over,
he worked the swinging pointer into
symbols that might in some way, by
some fortunate chance, help that helpless
people to resist the horror that lay
ahead.</p>
<p>And while heavy bodies crashed
against the door that Sykes was holding,
there came from some deep-hidden well
of memory an inspiration. There was
a man he had once met&mdash;a man who
had confided wondrous things; and
now, with the knowledge of these
others who had conquered space, he
could believe wholly what he had
laughed and joked about before. That
man, too, had claimed to have travelled
far from the earth; he had invented a
machine; his name&mdash;</p>
<p>The pointer was swinging in frenzied
haste to spell over and over the
name of a man, and the name, too, of
a forgotten place in the mountains of
Nevada. It was repeating the message;
then finished in one long crashing wail
as a cloud of vapor shot about McGuire
and his hand upon the pointer went
suddenly limp.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Captain Blake&rsquo;s</span> game of solitaire
had become an obsession.
He drove himself to the utmost in the
line of duty, and, through the day, the
demands of the flying field filled his
mind to forgetfulness. And for the
rest, he forced his mind to concentrate
upon the turn of the cards. He could
not read&mdash;and he must not think!&mdash;so
he sat through long evenings trying
vainly to forget.</p>
<p>He looked up with an expressionless
face as Colonel Boynton entered the
room. The colonel saw the cards and
nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that help?&rdquo; he asked, and
added without waiting for an answer,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like cards, but I find my
mathematics works well.... My old
problems&mdash;I can concentrate on them,
and stop this eternal, damnable thinking,
thinking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something of the same
look forming about the eyes of both&mdash;that
look that told of men who
struggled gamely under the sentence
of death, refusing to think or to fear,
and waiting, waiting, impotently.
Blake looked at the colonel with a
carefully emotionless gaze. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hell
in the big towns, I hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Colonel nodded. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t blame
them much, if that&rsquo;s what appeals to
them. A year and a half!&mdash;and they&rsquo;ve
got to forget it. Why not crowd all
the recklessness and excesses they can
into the time that is left?&mdash;poor devils!
But for the most part the world is wagging
along, and people are going
through the familiar motions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Blake, &ldquo;I used to wonder
at times how a man might feel if
he were facing execution. Now we all
know. Just going dumbly along, feeling
as little as we can, thinking of anything,
everything&mdash;except the one
thing. They&rsquo;ve turned to using dope,
a lot of them, I hear. Maybe it helps;
nobody cares much. Only a year and
a half.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>He</span> raised his face from which all
expression was consciously
erased. &ldquo;Any possible hope?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Or do we take it when it comes and
fight with what we&rsquo;ve got as long as
we can? There was some talk in the
papers of an invention&mdash;Bureau of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
Standards cooperating with the big
General Committee to investigate.
Anything come of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand of them,&rdquo; said the
colonel, &ldquo;all futile. No, we can&rsquo;t expect
much from those things. Though
there&rsquo;s a whisper that came to me from
Washington. General Clinton&mdash;you
may remember him; he was here when
the thing first broke&mdash;says that some
scientist, a real one, not another of
these half-baked geniuses, has worked
out a transformation of some kind. It
was too deep for me, but it is based
upon changing hydrogen into helium,
I think. Liberates some perfectly tremendous
amount of power. The general
had it all down pat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped speaking at the change
in Captain Blake&rsquo;s face. The careful
repression of all emotions was gone;
the face was suddenly alive&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said sharply; &ldquo;I remember
something of the theory.
There is a difference in the atoms or
their protons&mdash;the liberation of an
electron from each atom&mdash;matter actually
transformed into energy; theoretical,
what I have read. But&mdash;but&mdash;Oh
my God, Boynton, do you mean that
they&rsquo;ve got it?&mdash;that it will drive us
through space?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> colonel drove one fist into the
palm of his other hand. &ldquo;Fool!
Idiot!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and it was evident
that the epithets were intended
for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had forgotten that you had been
trained along that line. The general
wants a man to work with them, somewhat
as a liason officer to link the
army requirements closely with their
developments; we are hoping to work
out a space ship, of course. You are
just the man; I will radio him this
minute. Be ready to leave&mdash;&rdquo; The
slamming of the door marked a hurried
exit toward the radio room.</p>
<p>And abruptly, stifflingly, Captain
Blake dared to hope. &ldquo;Scientists will
come through with something, some
new method of propulsion. All the
world is looking to them!&rdquo; His
thoughts were leaping from one possibility
to another. &ldquo;Some miracle of
power that will drive a fleet through
space as they have done, to battle with
the enemy on his own ground&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could he help? Was there one little
thing that he could do to apply their
knowledge to practical ends? The
thought thrilled him with overpowering
emotion an hour later as he felt
the lift of the plane beneath him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Report to General Clinton,&rdquo; the
colonel&rsquo;s reply had said. &ldquo;Captain
Blake will be assigned to special duty.&rdquo;
He opened the throttle to his ship&rsquo;s
best cruising speed, but his spirit was
soaring ahead to urge on the swift
scout ship whose wings drove steadily
into the gathering dusk.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>And</span> then, after long hours, Washington!
Brief words with many
men&mdash;and discouragement! The seat of
government of the United States was
a city of despondent men, weary, hopeless,
but fighting. There was a look of
strain on every face; the eyes told a
story of sleepless nights and futile
thinking and planning. Blake&rsquo;s elation
was short lived.</p>
<p>He was sent to New York and on
into the state, where the laboratories
of a great electrical company had
turned their equipment from commercial
purposes to those of war. Here,
surely, one might find fuel to feed the
dying embers of hope; the new development
must give greater promise than
General Clinton had intimated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing you can do as yet,&rdquo; he was
told, when he had stated his mission.
&ldquo;It is still experimental, but we have
worked out the transformation on a
small scale, and harnessed the power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Blake was in no mood for
temporizing; he was tired with being
put off. He stared belligerently at the
chief of this department.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Power&mdash;hell!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
power now. How will you apply it?
How will we use it for travelling
through space?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span></div>
<p>The great man of science was unmoved
by the outburst. &ldquo;That is poppycock,&rdquo;
he replied; &ldquo;the unscientific
twaddle of the sensational press. We
are practical men here; we are working
to give you men who do the fighting
better ships and better arms. But
you will use them right here on Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The calm assurance of this man who
spoke with a voice of such confidence
and authority left the flyer speechless.
His brain sent a chaos of profane and
violent expletives to the lips that dared
not frame them. There was no adequate
reply.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Blake</span> jammed his hat upon his
head and walked blindly from the
room. Heedless of the protests of
those he jostled on the street he went
raging on, but some subconscious urge
directed his steps. He found himself
at the railway. There was a station,
and a grilled window where he was
asking for a ticket back to Washington.
And on the following day&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing I can do,&rdquo; he told
General Clinton. &ldquo;It is hopeless. I
ask to be relieved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; The general snapped the
question at him. What kind of man
was this that Boynton had sent him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are fools,&rdquo; said Blake bluntly,
&ldquo;pompous, well-meaning fools!
They are planning better motors, more
power&rdquo;&mdash;he laughed harshly&mdash;&ldquo;and
they think that with them we can attack
ships that are independent of the
air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; asked General Clinton coldly,
&ldquo;for what purpose do you wish to
be relieved? What do you intend to
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Return to the field,&rdquo; said Captain
Blake, &ldquo;to work, and put my planes and
personnel in the best possible condition;
then, when the time comes, go up
and fight like hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An unusual phrasing of a request
when one is addressing one&rsquo;s commander;
but the older man threw back
his shoulders, that were bending under
responsibilities too great for one
man to bear, and took a long breath
that relaxed his face and seemed to
bring relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the right idea,&rdquo;&mdash;he
spoke slowly and thoughtfully&mdash;&ldquo;the
right philosophy. It is all we have left&mdash;to
fight like hell when the time
comes. Give my regards to Colonel
Boynton; he sent me a good man after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Another</span> long flight, westward
this time, and, despite the failure
of his hopes and of his errand, Blake
was flying with a mind at peace. &ldquo;It is
all we have left,&rdquo; the general had said.
Well, it was good to face facts, to admit
them&mdash;and that was that! There
was no use of thinking or worrying....
He lifted the ship to a higher level
and glanced at his compass. There
were clouds up ahead, and he drove
still higher into the night, until he was
above them.</p>
<p>And again his peace of mind was not
to last.</p>
<p>It was night when he swung the ship
over his home port and signalled for
a landing. A flood of light swept out
across the field to guide him down. He
went directly to the colonel&rsquo;s quarters
but found him gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the radio room, I think,&rdquo; an orderly
told him.</p>
<p>Colonel Boynton was listening intently
in the silent room; he scowled
with annoyance at the disturbance of
Blake&rsquo;s coming; then, seeing who it
was, he motioned quickly for the captain
to listen in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord, Blake,&rdquo; he told the captain
in an excited whisper; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
you&rsquo;re here. Another ship had been
sighted; she&rsquo;s been all over the earth;
just scouting and mapping, probably.
And there have been signals the same
as before&mdash;the same until just now.
Listen!&mdash;it&rsquo;s talking Morse!&mdash;it&rsquo;s been
calling for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thrust a head set into Blake&rsquo;s
hands, then reached for some papers.
&ldquo;Poor reception, but there&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve
got,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> paper held the merest fragments
of messages that the
operator had deciphered. Blake examined
them curiously while he listened
at the silent receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maricopa&rdquo;&mdash;the message, whatever
it was, was meant for them, but there
were only parts of words and disjointed
phrases that the man had written
down&mdash;&ldquo;Venus attacking Earth ...
Captain Blake ... Sykes and....&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the name of Sykes, Blake dropped
the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Sykes!&mdash;why Sykes was the
astronomer who was captured with
McGuire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! Listen!&rdquo; The colonel&rsquo;s voice
was almost shrill with excitement.</p>
<p>The night was whispering faintly
the merest echo of a signal from a station
far away, but it resolved itself
into broken fragments of sound that
were long and short in duration, and
the fragments joined to form letters
in the Morse code.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See Winslow,&rdquo; it told them, and repeated
the message: &ldquo;See Winslow at
Sierra....&rdquo; Some distant storm crashed
and rattled for breathless minutes.
&ldquo;Blake see Winslow. This is McGuire,
Blake. Winslow can help&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The message ended abruptly. One
long, wailing note; then again the
night was voiceless ... and in the radio
room at Maricopa Flying Field two
men stood speechless, unbreathing, to
stare at each other with incredulous
eyes, as might men who had seen a
phantom&mdash;a ghost that spoke to them
and called them by name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;McGuire&mdash;is&mdash;alive!&rdquo; stammered
Blake. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve taken him&mdash;there!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Colonel Boynton</span> was considering,
weighing all the possibilities,
and his voice, when he answered,
had the ring of conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was no hoax,&rdquo; he agreed;
&ldquo;that quavering tone could never be
faked. That message was sent from the
same station we heard before. Yes,
McGuire is alive&mdash;or was up to the
end of that sending.... But, who the
devil is Winslow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blake shook his head despairingly.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And it seems
as if I should&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was hours later, far into the night,
when he sprang from out of a half-conscious
doze to find himself in the
middle of the floor with the voice of
McGuire ringing clearly in his ears. A
buried memory had returned to the
level of his conscious mind. He
rushed over to the colonel&rsquo;s quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; he shouted to that officer
whose head was projecting from
an upper window. &ldquo;I remember! McGuire
told me about this Winslow&mdash;some
hermit that he ran across. He
has some invention&mdash;some machine&mdash;said
he had been to the moon. I always
thought Mac half believed him. We&rsquo;ll
go over Mac&rsquo;s things and find the address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think&mdash;do you suppose&mdash;?&rdquo;
began Colonel Boynton doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare to think,&rdquo; Blake responded.
&ldquo;God only knows if we dare
hope; but Mac&mdash;Mac&rsquo;s got a level
head; he wouldn&rsquo;t send us unless he
knew! Good Lord, man!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;Mac radioed us from Venus;
is there anything impossible after
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait there,&rdquo; said Colonel Boynton;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Lieutenant McGuire</span> awoke,
as he had on other occasions, to
the smell of sickly-sweet fumes and
the stifling pressure of a mask held
over his nose and mouth. He struggled
to free himself, and the mask was
removed. Another of the man-creatures
whom McGuire had not seen
before helped him to sit up.</p>
<p>A group of the attenuated figures,
with their blood-and-ashes faces, regarded
him curiously. The one who
had helped him arise forced the others
to stand back, and he gave McGuire a
drink of yellow fluid from a crystal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
goblet. The dazed man gulped it down
to feel a following surge of warmth
and life that pulsed through his paralyzed
body. The figures before him
came sharply from the haze that had
enveloped them. A window high above
admitted a golden light that meant another
day, but it brought no cheer or
encouragement to the flyer. McGuire
felt crushed and hopeless in the knowledge
that his life must still go on.</p>
<p>If only that sleep could have continued&mdash;carried
him out to the deeper
sleep of death! What hope for them
here? Not a chance! And then he remembered
Sykes; he mustn&rsquo;t desert
Sykes. He looked about him to see the
same prison room from which he and
Sykes had escaped. The body of the
scientist was motionless on the hammock-bed
across the room; an occasional
deep-drawn breath showed that
the man still lived.</p>
<p>No, he must not leave Sykes, even if
he had the means of death. They
would fight it through together, and
perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;they might yet be
of service, might find some way to
avert the catastrophe that threatened
their world. Hopeless? Beyond doubt.
But he must hope&mdash;and fight!</p>
<p>The leader had watched the light of
understanding as it returned to the
flyer&rsquo;s eyes. He motioned now to the
others, and McGuire was picked up
bodily by four of them and carried
from the room.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>McGuire&rsquo;s</span> mind was alert once
more; he was eager to learn
what he could of this place that was
to be their prison, but he saw little. A
glory of blending colors beyond, where
the golden light from without shone
through opal walls&mdash;then he found
himself upon a narrow table where
straps of metal were thrown quickly
about to bind him fast. He was tied
hand and foot to the table that moved
forward on smooth rollers to a waiting
lift.</p>
<p>What next? he questioned. Not
death, for they had been too careful to
keep him alive, these repulsive things
that stared at him with such cold
malevolence. Then what? And McGuire
found himself with unpleasant
recollections of others he had seen
strapped in similar fashion to an operating
table.</p>
<p>The lift that he had thought would
rise fell smoothly, instead, to stop at
some point far below ground where
the table with its helpless burden was
rolled into a great room.</p>
<p>He could move his head, and McGuire
turned and twisted to look at the
maze of instruments that filled the
room&mdash;a super-laboratory for experiments
of which he dared not think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever says I&rsquo;m not scared to
death is a liar,&rdquo; he whispered to himself,
but he continued to look and wonder
as he was wheeled before a gleaming
machine of many coils and shining,
metal parts. A smooth sheet of
metal stood vertically beyond him;
painted a grayish-white, he saw; but he
could not imagine its use. A throng
of people, seated in the room, turned
blood-red faces toward the bound man
and the metal sheet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if we were about to put
on a show of some kind,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;and I am cast for a leading role.&rdquo;
He watched as best he could from his
bound position while a tall figure in
robes of lustreless black appeared to
stand beside him.</p>
<p>The newcomer regarded him with a
face that was devoid of all emotion.
McGuire felt the lack of the customary
expression of hatred; there was not
even that; and he knew he was nothing
more than a strange animal, bound, and
helpless, ready for this weird creature&rsquo;s
experiments. The one in black
held a pencil whose tip was a tiny, brilliant
light.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Abruptly</span> the room plunged to
darkness, where the only visible
thing was this one point of light.
Ceaselessly it waved back and forth
before his eyes; he followed it in a
pattern of strange design; it approached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
and receded. Again and
again the motion was repeated, until
McGuire felt himself sinking&mdash;sinking&mdash;into
a passive state of lethargy. His
muscles relaxed; his mind was at rest;
there seemed nothing in the entire universe
of being but the single point of
light that drew him on and on ... till
something whispered from the far
reaches of black space....</p>
<p>It came to him, an insistent call. It
was asking about the earth&mdash;his own
world. <i>What of Earth&rsquo;s armies and
their means of defense?</i> Vaguely he
sensed the demand, and without conscious
volition he responded. He pictured
the world he had known; how
plainly he saw the wide field at Maricopa,
and the sweeping flight of a
squadron of planes! <i>Yes&mdash;yes! How
high could they ascend?</i> From one of
the planes he saw the world below; the
ships were near their ceiling; this
was the limit of their climb. <i>And did
they fight with gas? What of their
deadliness?</i> And again he was seated
in a plane, and he was firing tiny bullets
from a tiny gun. No. They did
not use gas. <i>But on the ground below&mdash;what
fortifications? What means of
defense?</i></p>
<p>McGuire&rsquo;s mind was no longer his
own; he could only respond to that invisible
questioner, that insistent demand
from out of the depths where he
was floating. And yet there was something
within him that protested, that
clamored at his mind and brain.</p>
<p>Fortifications! They must know
about fortifications&mdash;anti-aircraft guns&mdash;means
for combatting aerial attack.
Yes, he knew, and he must explain&mdash;and
the thing within him pounded in
the back of his brain to draw him back
to himself.</p>
<p>He saw a battery of anti-aircraft
guns in operation; the guns were firing;
shells were bursting in little
plumes of smoke high in the air. And
that self within him was shouting now,
hammering at him; &ldquo;You are seeing it,&rdquo;
it told him; &ldquo;it is there before you on
the screen. Stop! Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>And</span> for an instant McGuire had
the strange experience of witnessing
his own thoughts. Memories,
mental records of past experience,
were flashing through his mind; mock
battles, and the batteries were firing!
And, before him, on the metal screen,
there glowed a vivid picture of the
same thing. Men were serving the
guns with sure swiftness; the bursts
were high in the air&mdash;in a flash of
understanding Lieutenant McGuire knew
that he was giving his country&rsquo;s secrets
to the enemy. And in that same instant
he felt himself swept upward
from the depths of that darkness
where he had drifted. He was himself
again, bound and helpless before
an infernal contrivance of these devil-creatures.
They had read his thoughts;
the machine beside him had projected
them upon the screen for all to see; a
steady clicking might mean their
reproduction in motion pictures for
later study! He, Lieutenant McGuire,
was a traitor against his will!</p>
<p>The screen was blank, and the lights
of the room came on to show the thin
lips that smiled complacently in a cruel
and evil face.</p>
<p>McGuire glared back into that face,
and he tried with all the mental force
that he could concentrate to get across
to the exultant one the fact that they
had not wholly conquered him. This
much they had got&mdash;but no more!</p>
<p>The thin-lipped one had an instrument
in his hand, and McGuire felt
the prick of a needle plunged into his
arm. He tried to move his head and
found himself powerless. And now, in
the darkness of the room where all
lights were again extinguished, the
helpless man was fighting the most
horrible of battles, and the battleground
was within his own mind. He
was two selves, and he fought and
struggled with all his consciousness to
keep those memories from flooding
him.</p>
<p>With one part of himself he knew
what it meant: a sure knowledge given
these invaders of what they must prepare
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
to meet; he was betraying his
country; the whole of humanity! And
that raging, raving self was powerless
to check the flow of memory pictures
that went endlessly through his mind
and out upon the screen beyond....</p>
<p>He had no sense of time; he was
limp and exhausted with his fruitless
struggle when he felt himself released
from the bondage of the metal straps
and placed again in the hammock in
his room. And he could only look
wanly and hopelessly after the figure
of Professor Sykes, carried by barbarous
figures to the same ordeal.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Sleep</span>, through the long night, restored
both McGuire and his companion
to normal strength. The flyer
was seated with his head bowed low in
his cupped hands. His words seemed
wrung from an agony of spirit. &ldquo;So
that&rsquo;s what they brought us here for,&rdquo;
he said harshly; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re
keeping us alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Sykes walked back and
forth in their bare room while he shook
his impotent fists in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told them everything,&rdquo; he exploded;
&ldquo;everything!&rdquo; Their astronomical
knowledge must be limited; under
this blanket of clouds they can see
nothing, and from their ships they
could make approximations only.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have told them&mdash;the earth,
and its days and seasons&mdash;its orbital
velocity and motion&mdash;its relation to
the orbit of this accursed planet.
They had documents from the observatory
and I explained them; I corrected
their time of firing their big gun on its
equatorial position. Oh, there is little
I left untold&mdash;damn them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to heaven,&rdquo; said the flyer
savagely, &ldquo;that we had known; we
would have jumped out of their beastly
ship somehow ten thousand feet up,
and we would have taken our information
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sykes nodded agreement. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
he asked, &ldquo;how about to-morrow, and
the next day, and the next? They will
want more facts; they will pump the
last drop of information from us. Are
we going to allow it?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>McGuire&rsquo;s</span> tone was dry. &ldquo;You
know the answer to that as well
as I do. We have just two alternatives;
either we get out of here&mdash;find
some place to hide in, then find some
way to put a crimp in their plans; or
we get out of here for good. It&rsquo;s
twenty feet, not twenty thousand, from
that window to the ground, but I
think a head-first dive would do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sykes did not reply at once; he
seemed to be weighing some problem
in his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would prefer the water,&rdquo; he said
at last. &ldquo;If we <i>can</i> get away and reach
the shore, and if there is not a possibility
of escape&mdash;which I must admit I
consider highly improbable&mdash;well, we
can always swim out as far as we can
go, and the result will be certain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This other is so messy.&rdquo; The man
had stopped his ceaseless pacing, and
he even managed a cheerful smile at
the lieutenant. &ldquo;And, remember, it
might only cripple us and leave us
helpless in their hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds all right to me,&rdquo; McGuire
agreed, and there was a tone of finality
in his voice as he added: &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
made us do that traitor act for the
last time, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Daylight</span> comes slowly through
cloud-filled skies; the window of
the room where the fountain sprayed
ceaselessly was showing the first hint
of gold in the eastern sky. Above was
the utter darkness of the cloud-wrapped
night as the two men swung
noiselessly out into the grotesque
branches of a tree to make their way
into the gloom below. There, under
the cover of great leaves, they
crouched in silence, while the darkness
about them faded and a sound of
subdued whistling noises came to them
from the night.</p>
<p>A wheel creaked, and in the dim
light two figures appeared tugging at
a cart upon which was a cage of woven
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
wire. Beyond them, against the
darker background of denser growth,
tentacles coiled and twisted above the
row of guardian plants that surrounded
the house.</p>
<p>One of the ghostly forms reached
within the cage and brought forth a
struggling object that whimpered in
fear. The low whine came distinctly
to the hidden men. They saw a vague
black thing tossed through the air and
toward the deadly plants; they heard
the swishing of pliant tentacles and
the yelping cry of a frightened animal.
And the cry rose to a shriek that ended
with the gulping splash of thick liquid.</p>
<p>The giant pod next in line was open&mdash;they
could see it dimly&mdash;and its tentacles
were writhing convulsively,
hungrily, across the ground. Another
animal was taken from the cage and
thrown to the waiting, serpent forms
that closed about and whirled it high
in air. Another&mdash;and another! The
yelps of terror grew faint in the distance
as the monsters passed on in
their gruesome work. And the two
men, palpitant with memories of their
own experience, were limp and sick
with horror.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>In</span> the growing light they saw more
plainly the fleshy, pliant arms that
whipped through the air or felt searchingly
along the ground. No hope there
for bird or beast that passed by in the
night; nor for men, as they knew too
well. But now, as the golden light
increased, the arms drew back to form
again the tight-wound coils that flattened
themselves beside the monstrous
pods whose lips were closing. Locked
within them were the pools of liquid
that could dissolve a living body into
food for these vampires of the vegetable
world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damnable!&rdquo; breathed Sykes in a
savage whisper. &ldquo;Utterly damnable!
And this world is peopled with such
monsters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last deadly arm was tightly
coiled when the men stole off through
the lush growth that reached even
above their heads. McGuire remembered
the outlines he had seen from
the air and led the way where, if no
better concealment could be found, the
ocean waited with promise of rest and
release from their inhuman captors.</p>
<p>They counted on an hour&rsquo;s start&mdash;it
would be that long before their jailer
would come with their morning meal
and give the alarm&mdash;and now they
went swiftly and silently through the
stillness of a strange world. The air
that flicked misty-wet across their
faces was heavy and heady with the
perfume of night-blooming plants.
Crimson blossoms flung wide their
odorous petals, and the first golden
light was filtered through tremendous
tree-growths of pale lavenders and
grays to show as unreal colors in the
vegetation close about them.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>They</span> found no guards; the isolation
of this island made the land
itself their prison, and the men ran at
full speed through every open space,
knowing as they ran that there was no
refuge for them&mdash;only the ocean waiting
at the last. But their flight was
not unobserved.</p>
<p>A great bird rose screaming from a
tangle of vines; its heavy, flapping
wings flashed red against the pale
trees. A pandemonium of shrieking
cries echoed its alarm as other birds
took flight; the forest about them was
in an uproar of harsh cries. And faintly,
from far in the rear, came a babel
of shrill calls&mdash;weird, inhuman!&mdash;the
voices of the men-things of Venus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all off,&rdquo; said McGuire sharply;
&ldquo;they&rsquo;ll be on our trail now!&rdquo; He
plunged through where the trees were
more open, and Sykes was beside him
as they ran with a burst of speed toward
a hilltop beyond.</p>
<p>They paused, panting, upon the
crest. A wide expanse of foliage in
delicate shadings swept out before
them to wave gently in a sea of color
under the morning breeze, and beyond
was another sea that beckoned with
white breakers on a rocky shore.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The ocean!&rdquo; gasped Sykes, and
pointed a trembling hand toward their
goal. &ldquo;But&mdash;I had no idea&mdash;that suicide&mdash;was&mdash;such
hard work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall figure of Lieutenant McGuire
turned to the shorter, breathless
man, and he gripped hard at one of his
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sykes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never get another
chance to say it&mdash;but you&rsquo;re one
good scout!... Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>McGuire</span> fought to force his way
through jungle growth, while
screaming birds marked where they
went. The sounds of their pursuers
were close behind them when the two
tore their way through the last snarled
tangle of pale vine to stand on a sheer
bluff, where, below, deep waters
crashed against a rocky wall. They
staggered with weariness and gulped
sobbingly of the morning air. McGuire
could have sworn he was exhausted
beyond any further effort, yet
from somewhere he summoned energy
to spring savagely upon a tall, blood-red
figure whose purpling face rose
suddenly to confront them.</p>
<p>One hand closed upon the metal tube
that the other hand raised, and, with
his final reserve of strength, the flyer
wrapped an arm about the tall body and
rushed it stumblingly toward the cliff.
To be balked now!&mdash;to be brought back
to that intolerable prison and the unthinkable
role of traitor! The khaki-clad
figure wrenched furiously at the
deadly tube as they struggled and
swayed on the edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>He freed his arm quickly, and, regardless
of the clawing thing that tore
at his face and eyes, he launched one
long swing for the horrible face above
him. He saw the awkward fall of a
lean body, and he swayed helplessly
out to follow when the grip of Sykes&rsquo;
hand pulled him back and up to momentary
safety.</p>
<p>McGuire&rsquo;s mind held only the desire
to kill, and he would have begun
a staggering rush toward the shrieking
mob that broke from the cover behind
them, had not Sykes held him fast. At
sight of the weapon, their own gas projector,
still clutched in the flyer&rsquo;s hand,
the pursuers halted. Their long arms
pointed and their shrill calls joined in
a chorus that quavered and fell uncertainly.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>One</span>, braver than the rest, dashed
forward and discharged his
weapon. The spurting gas failed to
reach its intended victims; it blew
gently back toward the others who fled
quickly to either side. Above the
trees a giant ship nosed swiftly down,
and McGuire pointed to it grimly and
in silence. The men before them were
massed now for a rush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the end,&rdquo; said the flyer
softly. &ldquo;I wonder how this devilish
thing works; there&rsquo;s a trigger here. I
will give them a shot with the wind
helping, then we&rsquo;ll jump for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ship was above them as the slim
figure of Lieutenant McGuire threw
itself a score of paces toward the
waiting group. From the metal tube
there shot a stream of pale vapor that
swept downward upon the others who
ran in panic from its touch.</p>
<p>Then back&mdash;and a grip of a hand!&mdash;and
two Earth-men who threw themselves
out and downward from a sheer
rock wall to the cool embrace of deep
water.</p>
<p>They came to the top, battered from
their fall, but able to dive under a wave
and emerge again near one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swim!&rdquo; urged Sykes. &ldquo;Swim out!
They may get us here&mdash;recover our
bodies&mdash;resuscitate us. And that
wouldn&rsquo;t do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another wave, and the two men were
swimming beyond it; swimming feebly
but steadily out from shore, while
above them a great cylinder of shining
metal swept past in a circling flight.
They kept on while their eyes, from
the wave tops, saw it turn and come
slowly back in a long smooth descent.</p>
<p>It was a hundred feet above the water
a short way out at sea, and the
two men made feeble motions with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
arms and legs, while their eyes exchanged
glances of dismay.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>A door</span> had opened in the round
under-surface, and a figure, whose
gas-suit made it a bloated caricature of
a man, was lowered from beneath in a
sling. From the stern of the ship
gaseous vapor belched downward to
spread upon the surface of the water.
The wind was bringing the misty cloud
toward them. &ldquo;The gas!&rdquo; said McGuire
despairingly. &ldquo;It will knock us out,
and then that devil will get us!
They&rsquo;ll take us back! Our last chance&mdash;gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help us!&rdquo; said Sykes weakly.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t&mdash;even&mdash;die&mdash;&rdquo; His feeble
strokes stopped, and he sank beneath
the water. McGuire&rsquo;s last picture as
he too sank and the waters closed over
his head, was the shining ship hovering
beyond.</p>
<p>He wondered only vaguely at the
sudden whirling of water around him.
A solid something was rising beneath
his dragging feet; a firm, solid support
that raised him again to the surface.
He realized dimly the air about him,
the sodden form of Professor Sykes
some few feet distant. His numbed
brain was trying to comprehend what
else the eyes beheld.</p>
<p>A metal surface beneath them rose
higher, shining wet, above the water;
a metal tube raised suddenly from its
shield, to swing in quick aim upon the
enemy ship approaching from above.</p>
<p>His eyes moved to the ship, and to
the man-thing below in the sling.
Its clothes were a mass of flame, and
the figure itself was falling headlong
through the air. Above the blazing
body was the metal of the ship itself,
and it sagged and melted to a liquid
fire that poured, splashing and hissing,
to the waters beneath. In the wild
panic the great shape threw itself into
the air; it swept out and up in curving
flight to plunge headlong into the
depths....</p>
<p>The gas was drifting close, as McGuire
saw an opening in the structure
beside him. The voice of a man, human,
kindly, befriending, said something
of &ldquo;hurry&rdquo; and &ldquo;gas,&rdquo; and &ldquo;lift
them carefully but make haste.&rdquo; The
white faces of men were blurred and
indistinct as McGuire felt himself lowered
into a cool room and laid, with
the unconscious form of Sykes, upon a
floor.</p>
<p>He tried to remember. He had gone
down in the water&mdash;Sykes had
drowned, and he himself&mdash;he was tired&mdash;tired.
&ldquo;And this,&rdquo;&mdash;the thought
seemed a certainty in his mind&mdash;&ldquo;this
is death. How&mdash;very&mdash;peculiar&mdash;&rdquo; He
was trying to twist his lips to a weak
laugh as the lighted ports in the wall
beside him changed from gold to green,
then black&mdash;and a rushing of torn
waters was in his ears....</p>

</div>
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&ldquo;</small><span class='drop'>I</span><span class='dcap'> beg</span> your pardon, sir. I&rsquo;m looking
for Dr. Bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The famous Bureau of Standards
scientist appraised the
speaker rapidly. Keen blue eyes stared
questioningly at him from a mahogany
brown face, criss-crossed with a thousand
tiny wrinkles.
The tattooed
anchor on his
hand and the ill-fitting
blue serge
suit smacked of the sea while the
squareness of his shoulders and the direct
gaze of his eye spoke eloquently
of authority.</p>
<p class='sidebarright'>The trail of mystery gold leads Carnes
and Dr. Bird to a tremendous monster of
the deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dr. Bird, Captain. What can I
do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Doctor, but I&rsquo;m not a
captain. My name
is Mitchell and I
am, or was, the
first mate of the
<i>Arethusa</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Arethusa</i>!&rdquo; Operative Carnes
of the United States Secret Service
sprang to his feet. &ldquo;You said the <i>Arethusa</i>?
There <i>were</i> no survivors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that I am the only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been hiding and
why haven&rsquo;t you reported the fact of
your rescue to the proper authorities?
Tell the truth; I&rsquo;m a federal officer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carnes flashed the gold badge of the
Secret Service and an expression of
anger crossed Mitchell&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had wished to talk to an officer
I could have found plenty in New
York,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;I came to
Washington in order to tell my story to
Dr. Bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seaman and the detective glared
at one another for a moment and then
Dr. Bird intervened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pipe down, Carnes,&rdquo; he said softly.
&ldquo;Mr. Mitchell undoubtedly has reasons,
excellent reasons, for his actions. Sit
down, Mr. Mitchell, and have a cigar.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Mitchell</span> accepted the cigar
which the doctor proferred and
took a chair. He lighted the weed and
after another glance of hostility toward
the detective he pointedly ignored him
and addressed his remarks to Dr. Bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no objection to telling you
why I haven&rsquo;t spoken earlier, Doctor,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;When the <i>Arethusa</i> sank, I
must have hit my head on something,
for the next thing I knew, I was in the
Marine Hospital in New York. I had
been picked up unconscious by a fishing
boat and brought in, and I lay there
a week before I knew anything. When
I knew what I was doing I heard about
the loss of my ship and was told that
there were no survivors, and I didn&rsquo;t
know what to do. The story I had to
tell was so weird and improbable that
I hesitated to speak to anyone about it.
I was not sure at first that it was not a
trick of a disordered brain, but since
my head has cleared I am convinced of
the truth of it ... and yet I know that
it <i>can&rsquo;t</i> be so. I have read about you
and some of the things you have done,
and so as soon as I was able to travel I
came here to tell you about it. You
will be better able to judge than I,
whether what I tell you really happened
or was only a vision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Bird leaned back in his chair and
put the tips of his fingers together.
Long, tapering fingers they were, sensitive
and well shaped, though sadly
marred by acid stains. It was in his
hands alone that Dr. Bird showed the
genius in his make-up, the artistry
which inspired him to produce those
miracles of experimentation which had
made his name a household word in the
realm of science. Aside from those
hands he more resembled a pugilist
than a scientist. A heavy shock of unruly
black hair surmounted a face with
beetling black brows and a prognathous
jaw. His enormous head, with a
breadth and height of forehead which
were amazing, rose from a pillar-like
neck which sprang from a pair of massive
shoulders and the arching chest
of the trained athlete. Dr. Bird stood
six feet two inches in his socks, and
weighed over two hundred stripped. As
he leaned back a curious glitter, which
Carnes had learned to associate with
keen interest, showed for an instant in
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be glad to hear your story,
Mr. Mitchell,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Tell it
in your own way and try not to omit
any detail, no matter how trivial it may
be.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> seaman nodded and sat silent
for a moment as though marshaling
his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story really starts the afternoon
of May 12th,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;although I
didn&rsquo;t realize the importance of the
first incident at the time. We were
steaming along at good speed, hoping
to make New York before too late for
quarantine, when a hail came from the
forward lookout. I was on watch and I
went forward to see what was the matter.
The lookout was Louis Green, an
able bodied seaman and a good one, but
a confirmed drunkard. I asked him
what the trouble was and he turned toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
me a face that was haggard with
terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a sea serpent, Mr. Mitchell,&rsquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; I replied sharply.
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been drinking again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He swore that he hadn&rsquo;t and I asked
him to describe what he had seen. His
teeth were chattering so that he could
hardly speak, but he gasped out a story
about seeing a monstrous head, a half
mile across, he said, with a long snake
body stretching out over the sea until
the end of it was lost on the horizon. I
turned my glass in the direction he
pointed and of course there was nothing
to be seen. The man&rsquo;s condition
was such as to make him worse than
useless as a lookout, so I relieved him
and ordered him below. I took it for a
touch of delirium tremens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were bucking a head wind, although
not a very stiff one, and we
didn&rsquo;t make port until after dark, so we
anchored at quarantine, just off Staten
Island, in forty fathoms of water, and
Captain Murphy radioed for a Coast
Guard boat to come out and lay by us
for the night. As you have probably
heard, we were carrying four millions
in bar gold consigned to the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York from the
Bank of England.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Dr. Bird</span> and Carnes nodded. The
inexplicable loss of the <i>Arethusa</i>
had occupied much space in the papers
ten days earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cutter came out, signalled, and
dropped anchor about three hundred
yards away. So far, everything was
exactly as it should be. I walked to the
stern of the boat and looked out across
the Atlantic and then I realized that
Green wasn&rsquo;t the only one who could
see things. The wind had fallen and
it was getting pretty dark, but not too
dark to see things a pretty good distance
away. As I looked I saw, or
thought I saw, a huge black leathery
mass come to the surface a mile or so
away. There were two things on it that
looked like eyes, and I had a feeling as
though some malignant thing was staring
at me. I rubbed my eyes and
looked again, but the vision persisted,
and I went forward to get a glass.
When I came back the thing, whatever
it was, had disappeared, but the water
where it had been was boiling as
though there were a great spring or
something of the sort under the surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trained my glass on the disturbed
area, and I will take my oath that I saw
a huge body like a snake emerge from
the water. It lay in long undulations
on the waves, and moved with them as
though it were floating. It was quite a
bit nearer than the first thing had been
and I could see it plainly with the
glass. I would judge it to be fifteen or
twenty feet thick, and it actually
seemed to disappear in the distance as
Green had described it. The sight of
the thing sent shivers up and down my
spine, and I gave a hoarse shout. The
lookout hurried to my side and asked
me what the trouble was. I pointed and
handed him the glass. He looked
through it and handed it back to me
with a curious expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see nothing, sir,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took the glass from him and tried
to level it but my hands were trembling
so that I was forced to rest it on the
rail. The lookout was right. There
was absolutely nothing to be seen and
the peculiar appearance of the sea had
subsided to normal. The lookout was
staring at me rather curiously and I
knew that he was thinking the same
thing about me as I had thought about
Green in the afternoon. I made some
kind of an excuse and went below to
pull myself together. I caught a
glimpse of myself in the glass. I was
as white as a sheet, and the sweat was
running off my face in drops.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&ldquo;</small><span class='drop'>I</span><span class='dcap'> shook</span> myself together after a
fashion and managed to persuade
myself that the whole thing was just a
trick of my mind, inspired by Green&rsquo;s
vivid description of his delirious vision
of the afternoon. Eight bells struck,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
and when Mr. Fulton, the junior officer,
relieved me, I laid down and tried to
quiet myself. I didn&rsquo;t have much luck.
Just before I took the deck again at
midnight I slipped down to the forecastle
to see how Green was coming
along. He was lying in his bunk, wide
awake, with staring eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How are you feeling now, Green?&rsquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked up at me with an expression
of a man who has looked death in
the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t there no chance of dockin&rsquo;
to-night, Mr. Mitchell?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course not,&rsquo; I said rather sharply.
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? Are
you afraid your sea serpent will get
us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;ll get us if we stay out here to-night,
sir,&rsquo; he replied with an air of
conviction. &lsquo;I saw the horrible mouth
on him, large enough to bite this ship
in half; and it had a beak like a bird,
like a bloody parrot, sir. I saw its
horrible body, too, with great black
ulcers on the under side of it where the
sharks had been after it. For all the
shark takes a man now and then, he&rsquo;s
the seaman&rsquo;s friend, sir, because he
kills off the sea serpents who would
take ship and all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nonsense, Green!&rsquo; I said sharply.
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk any more such foolishness
or I&rsquo;ll have you ironed. You&rsquo;ve been
drinking so much that you are seeing
things, and I won&rsquo;t have the crew disturbed
by your crazy talk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You won&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s talk when
those big eyes stare into yours to-night,
Mr. Mitchell, and that body twists
around you and squeezes the life out of
you. I don&rsquo;t care whether you iron me
or not; I know that I&rsquo;m doomed and so
is everyone else; but I won&rsquo;t talk about
it, sir. The crew might as well rest
easy while they can, for there&rsquo;s no
escape if we have to stay out here
to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, be sure you keep a tight
mouth then,&rsquo; I said, and left rather hurriedly.
I was in a cold sweat, for his
air of conviction, together with what I
had seen, had shaken me pretty badly.
I heard the watch changing up above,
and knew there would be men in the
forecastle in a minute. I didn&rsquo;t want
to face them right then.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&ldquo;</small><span class='drop'>M</span><span class='dcap'>r. Fulton</span> reported everything
quiet when I went on
deck to relieve him, and although I surveyed
the water through a night glass
for as far as I could see, there was
nothing out of the way. The Coast
Guard&rsquo;s lights were shining less than a
quarter of a mile away, and things
looked peaceful enough. The wind had
gone down with the sun; the sea was
almost glassy, and there was a bright
moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After going around the ship, I relieved
all of the watch except two men
for lookouts, and sent them below to
get a good night&rsquo;s sleep. If I hadn&rsquo;t
done that, some of them might be alive
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I paced the deck for an hour trying
to quiet my nerves, but really getting
more nervous every minute. Three bells
struck and I walked forward and leaned
on the rail to watch the water. I saw
a peculiar swirl as though some large
body were coming to the surface from
below, and then I saw&mdash;it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Bird, I take a drink once in a
while when I am on shore, but never at
sea and never in excess, and I know it
wasn&rsquo;t a vision of drink delirium. I
felt perfectly normal aside from my
nervousness, and I don&rsquo;t think it was
fever. Either I saw it or I am insane,
for it is as vivid to me as though I were
standing on the <i>Arethusa&rsquo;s</i> deck and
that monstrous horror was rising once
more before my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seaman&rsquo;s face had become drawn
and white as he talked, and drops of
sweat were trickling from his chin.
Carnes sat forward absorbed in his narrative
while Dr. Bird sat back with a
glitter in his black eyes and an expression
of great attention on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Mr. Mitchell,&rdquo; the doctor
said soothingly. &ldquo;Tell me just what
you saw.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Mitchell</span> shuddered and glanced
quickly around the laboratory
as though to assure himself that he
was safe within four walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the surface of the sea,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;rose a massive body, black,
and of the appearance of wet leather.
It must have been a couple of hundred
yards across, although the size of objects
is often magnified by moonlight
and my terror may have added to its
size. In the midst of it were two great
discs, thirty feet across, which glowed
red with the reflected moonlight. It
stared for a moment and then rose
higher until it towered above the ship;
and then I saw, or thought I saw, a
huge gaping beak like a parrot&rsquo;s. It
was as Green had described it, large
enough to bite the <i>Arethusa</i> in half,
and she was a ship of three thousand
tons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was frozen with horror and
couldn&rsquo;t move or cry out. As I watched,
I saw the long snake-like body emerge
from the water, and the estimate I had
made of the size in the afternoon
seemed pitifully inadequate. Presently
a second and a third snake arose
from the water, and then more, until
the whole sea and the air above it
seemed a writhing mass of huge
snakes. I remember wondering why
the watch of the Coast Guard cutter
didn&rsquo;t sound an alarm, and then I
realized that the thing had arisen on
our port side and the cutter was on the
starboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mass of snakes writhed backward
and forward, and then two of
them rose in the air and hung over the
ship. I could see the under side and
I saw what Green had called the scars
where the sharks had attacked. They
were great cup-shaped depressions
with vile white edges, and they did
resemble huge sores or ulcers. They
wavered over the ship for an instant,
and then both of them dropped down
on the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found my voice and I think that
I gave a yell, but even as I opened my
mouth, I realized the futility of it.
The <i>Arethusa</i> was sucked down into
the sea as though it had been a tiny
chip. I saw the water rising to the
rail, and I think I cried out again.
The ship tilted and I felt myself falling.
The next thing I knew was when
I was in the hospital and was told that
I had been raving for a week. I was
afraid to tell my story for fear I would
be put in an asylum, so I kept a tight
tongue in my head until I was discharged.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Dr. Bird</span> mused for a moment as
the seaman&rsquo;s voice stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cried out all right, Mr. Mitchell,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;You gave two distinct
shouts, both of which were heard by
the watch on the <i>Wren</i>, the Coast
Guard cutter. They reported that at
1:30, the <i>Arethusa</i> sank without warning.
As soon as he heard your shouts,
the watch gave the alarm and the crew
piled on deck. The <i>Arethusa</i> was gone
completely and the <i>Wren</i> was tossing
about like &lsquo;a chip in a whirlpool&rsquo; as
they graphically described it. The
<i>Wren</i> had steam up and they fought
the waves and steamed over your anchoring
ground looking for survivors,
but they found none. The sea gradually
subsided and they did the only
thing they could do&mdash;dropped a buoy,
to guide the salvage people, and
radioed for assistance. The <i>Robin</i>
came out and joined them, and both
cutters stood by until daylight, but
nothing unusual was seen. The insurance
people are trying to salvage the
wreck now, but so far they have made
little headway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That brings me to the rest of the
story, the part that made me decide to
come to you, Doctor,&rdquo; said the seaman.
&ldquo;Did you see what happened to the
divers yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Bird nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a brief account of it,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It seems that two of them were lost
through their lines getting fouled and
their air connections severed in some
way. I don&rsquo;t believe the bodies have
been recovered yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;They never will be recovered, Doctor.
I was discharged from the hospital
yesterday and the papers were
just out with an account of it. I went
down to the dock where the <i>John
MacLean</i>, the salvage ship, ties up,
and I talked to Captain Starley who
commands it. I have known him casually
for some years, although not intimately,
and he gave me a few more
details than the press got. He didn&rsquo;t
connect me up at first with the Mitchell
who was reported lost on the <i>Arethusa</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first man to go down from the
<i>MacLean</i> was Charley Melrose, an expert
diver. He went down in a pressure
outfit to the bottom and started to
work. Everything was going along
fine until the telephone suddenly rang
and the man who answered it heard
him say, &lsquo;Raise me, for God&rsquo;s sake!
Hurry!&rsquo; The signal for raising was
given, but they hadn&rsquo;t got him more
than thirty feet from the bottom before
there came a tug on the line and
he was gone! The air line, the lifting
cable and the telephone cord floated
free and were reeled in. Melrose had
been plucked off the end of that line
as you or I would pluck off a grape.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Dr. Bird</span> leaned forward with the
curious glitter again in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said tersely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blake, the other diver, donned a
suit and insisted on being lowered at
once. Starley tried to dissuade him
but he insisted on going down. They
lowered him over the side with a
twelve-foot steel-shod pike in his hand.
He never got to the bottom. He had
not been lowered more than a hundred
feet when a scream came over the
telephone, and again there was a jerk
on the lines which threatened to wreck
the reel&mdash;and the line came aboard
with no diver on the end of it. At the
same time, Starley told me, the sea
boiled and churned as though the
whole bottom were coming up, and his
ship was tossed about as though it
were in a violent storm, although it
was calm enough for forty fathom salvage
work and that is pretty quiet, you
know. Half the time his screws were
out of water and he had a hard time to
keep from being capsized. He fought
his way out of the disturbed area, and
as soon as he did, it started to quiet
down, and in ten minutes it was calm
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starley was pretty badly shaken
and besides he had lost both of his
divers, so he came in and I saw him at
the dock. When I heard his yarn, I
took him into my confidence and told
him what I had seen and that I proposed
coming to you and asking your
advice. I was afraid until I heard his
story that it was merely a vision that
I had had, but it certainly was no
vision that plucked those two divers
off their lines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Captain Starley told that
story to anyone else yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Doctor, he hasn&rsquo;t. He promised
not to talk until after I had seen you.
I&rsquo;ll vouch for him; he&rsquo;ll keep his word
through anything; and he is keeping
his whole crew on board until he hears
from me.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Dr. Bird</span> sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mitchell,&rdquo; he said energetically,
&ldquo;you have shown excellent
judgment. Wire Captain Starley that
you have seen me and that he is to
hold his crew on board and to talk to
no one until I get there. Carnes, telephone
the Chief of Naval Operations
and ask him to receive me in conference
at once. Have him get the Secretary
of the Navy in, too, if he is available.
When you have finished that,
telephone Bolton that you will be
away from Washington indefinitely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll telephone Admiral Buck for
you, Doctor, but I don&rsquo;t dare telephone
any such message to Bolton; he&rsquo;d take
my head off. He has been running the
whole service ragged lately, and this
is my first afternoon off duty in a
fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble, a flood of new
counterfeits?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, the counterfeit division is getting
along all right. In point of fact,
they have lent us a dozen men. The
trouble is a sudden big increase in
Communist activity throughout the
country, with the Young Labor party
behind it. Bolton has been pretty
jumpy since that Stokowski affair last
August and he is afraid of another
attempt of some sort on the President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Young Labor party? I thought
that gang was bankrupt and out of
business, since the Coast Guard broke
up their alien smuggling scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were down and out for a
while, but they are in funds again&mdash;and
how! They must have three or
four millions at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did they get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we have been trying to
find out. The leaders have presented
bars of gold to a dozen banks throughout
the country and demanded specie.
The banks shipped the gold to the
mint and it was good gold, nine hundred
and twenty-five fine. What we
are trying to find out is how that gold
got into the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shipment of that size should be
easy to trace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem so, but it hasn&rsquo;t
been. We have accounted for every
pound of every shipment that has
come in through a port of entry, and
we have checked almost that close on
the output of every mine in the United
States. If the gold came from Russia,
it would have had to cross Europe, and
we can&rsquo;t get any trace of it from
abroad. It looks as though they were
<i>making</i> it.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Dr. Bird</span> rubbed his head thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possible, but hardly probable,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;How much did you say they
had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over three millions in thirty-pound
bars. Each bar shows signs of having
a mint mark chiselled off, but that
don&rsquo;t help much for they have done
too good a job. It has us pretty well
bluffed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Dr. Bird rubbed his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telephone Admiral Buck, and then
phone Bolton and tell him exactly
what I told you to: that you will
be away indefinitely. When he gets
through exploding, tell him that you
are going with me and that possibly,
just barely possibly, we might be on
the trail of that gold shipment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the trail of the gold!&rdquo; gasped
Carnes. &ldquo;Surely, Doctor, you don&rsquo;t
think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once in a while, old dear,&rdquo; replied
the Doctor with a chuckle, &ldquo;which is
more than anyone in the Secret Service
does. You might tell Bolton that
I said that, but hang up quickly if you
do. I don&rsquo;t want the wires of my telephone
melted off. No, Carnesy, I have
no miraculous inspiration as to where
that gold is coming from; I just have
a plain old-fashioned hunch, and that
hunch is that we are going to have lots
of fun and more than our share of
danger before we see Washington
again. After you get through bearding
Bolton in his den, you might call
the Chief of the Air Corps and ask
him to have a bomber held at Langley
Field subject to my orders. If he
squawks any, I&rsquo;ll talk to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to a telephone which
stood on his desk and lifted the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get Mr. Lambertson on the wire,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;He is the chief technician
of the Pyrex Glass Works at Corning,
New Jersey.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> <i>U.S.S. Minneconsin</i> steamed
out of New York harbor and
headed down toward the lower bay.
On her forward deck rested a huge
globe. The bottom quarter of the
sphere was made of some dark opaque
substance but the upper portion was
transparent as crystal. Through the
walls could be seen a quantity of apparatus
resting on the opaque bottom
portion. Two mechanics from the Bureau
of Standards were making final
adjustments of one of the pieces of
apparatus, which resembled a tank
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
fitted with a piston geared to an electric
motor. From the tank, tubes ran
to four hollow pipes, an inch and a
half in diameter, which ran through
the skin and extended thirty inches
from the outer skin of the twenty-foot
sphere. Dr. Bird stood near talking
with the executive officer of the ship
and from time to time giving a brief
word of direction to the mechanics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s safer than you might think,
Commander,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In the first
place, that globe is not made of ordinary
glass; it is made of vitrilene, a
new semi-malleable glass which was
developed at the Bureau and which is
being made on an experimental scale
for us by the Pyrex people. It is much
stronger than ordinary glass, and is
not sensitive to shock. It is also perfectly
transparent to ultra-violet light,
being superior even to rock crystal or
fused quartz in that respect. The
walls, as you have noticed, are four
inches thick, and I have calculated that
the ball will stand a uniform external
pressure of thirty-five hundred atmospheres,
the pressure which would be
encountered at a depth of about twenty
miles. I believe that it will stand a
squeeze of six thousand tons without
buckling, and it is impossible to fracture
it by shock. It could be dropped
from the top of the Woolworth Building,
and it would just bounce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems incredible that it could
stand such a pressure as you have
named.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My figures are conservative ones.
Lambertson calculated them even higher,
but we allowed for the fact that
this is the first large mass of the material
to be cast, and lowered them.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&ldquo;</small><span class='drop'>B</span><span class='dcap'>ut</span> suppose your lifting cable
should break?&rdquo; objected the
naval officer. &ldquo;The outfit weighs a
good many tons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You notice that the lower quarter is
made of lead. The specific gravity of
the entire globe when sealed up tight
with two men in it is only a little more
than unity. In the water its weight
is so little that a three-inch manilla
hawser would raise it, let alone a steel
cable. I have another safety device.
Granted that the cable should snap, I
can detach the lead from it and it
would shoot to the surface like a
rocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long can you remain under
water in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A week, if necessary. I have an
oxygen tank and a carbon dioxide removing
apparatus which will keep the
air in good condition. The globe is
electrically lighted, and can be heated
if necessary. Should my telephone
line become fouled and broken, I have
a radio set which will enable me to
communicate with you. I can&rsquo;t see
that it is especially dangerous; not
nearly as much so as a submarine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your object in going down,
if I may ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To take pictures and to explore the
wreck if we can. The globe is equipped
with huge floodlights and excellent
cameras. The salvage people are having
a little trouble and we are trying
to help them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mentioned exploring. Can you
leave the globe while it is under
water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. There is a locking device for
doing so. A man in a diving suit can
enter the lock and fill it with water.
Once the external pressure is released
he can open the outer door and step
out. Coming back, he seals the outer
door and the man inside blows out the
lock and compressed air and then the
inner door can be opened. It is the
same principle as a torpedo tube.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>A jangle</span> of bells interrupted
them and the <i>Minneconsin</i>
slowed down. Commander Lawrence
stepped to the rail and gave a sharp
order to the navigating officer on the
bridge. The bells jangled again and
the ship&rsquo;s engines stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are almost over the buoy, Doctor,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Bird nodded and spoke to the
two mechanics. With a few final
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
touches to the apparatus they emerged
from the globe and Dr. Bird entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Carnes,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;No
backing out at the last minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carnes stepped forward with a sickly
smile and joined the Doctor in the
huge sphere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, boys; close her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mechanics swung the outer door
into place with a crane. Both the edge
of the door and the surface against
which it fitted had been ground flat
and were in addition faced with soft
rubber. Bolts were fastened in the
door which passed through holes in the
main sphere, and Dr. Bird spun nuts
onto them and tightened them with a
heavy wrench. He and Carnes lifted
the smaller inner door into place and
bolted it tight. Dr. Bird stepped to
the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lower away,&rdquo; he directed.</p>
<p>From a boom attached to the <i>Minneconsin&rsquo;s</i>
forward fighting top, a huge
steel cable swung down, and the latch
at the end of the cable was closed over
a vitrilene ring which was fastened to
the top of the sphere. The cable tightened
and the globe with the two men
in it was lifted over the side of the
battleship and lowered gently into the
water. Carnes involuntarily ducked
and threw up his hand as the waters
closed over them. Dr. Bird laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look up, Carnes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Carnes gasped as he looked up and
saw the surface of the water above
him. Dr. Bird laughed again and
turned to the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lower away,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Everything
is tight.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> globe descended into the
depths of the sea. Darker and
darker it grew until only a faint twilight
glow filled the sphere. A dark
bulk loomed before them. Dr. Bird
snapped on one of his huge floodlights
and pointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Arethusa</i>,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The ill-fated vessel lay on her side
with a huge jagged hole torn in her
fabric amidships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where her boilers burst,&rdquo;
explained the Doctor. &ldquo;Luckily we
have a hard bottom to deal with. Let&rsquo;s
see if we can locate any of Mitchell&rsquo;s
sea serpents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned on other flood lights and
swept the bottom of the sea with them.
The huge beams bored out into the
water for a quarter of a mile, but nothing
unusual was to be seen. Dr. Bird
turned his attention again to the wreck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things look normal from this side,&rdquo;
he said after a prolonged scrutiny.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the <i>Minneconsin</i> steam
around it while we look it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response to his telephone orders
the ship above them swung around the
wreck in a circle, and Carnes and the
Doctor viewed each side in turn. But
nothing of a suspicious nature made
its appearance. The sphere stopped
opposite the hole in the side and
Dr. Bird turned to Carnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put on a diving suit
and explore that wreck,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If
there ever was any danger, it isn&rsquo;t apparent
now; and I can&rsquo;t find out anything
until I get inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, Doctor!&rdquo; cried Carnes.
&ldquo;Remember what happened to the
other divers!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&ldquo;</small><span class='drop'>W</span><span class='dcap'>e</span> don&rsquo;t know what happened
to them, Carnes. No matter
what it was, there is no danger apparent
right now, and I&rsquo;ve got to get into
that ship before I can get any real information.
We could have lowered an
under-sea camera and learned as much
as we have so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go instead of you, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to refuse you, old dear,
but frankly, I wouldn&rsquo;t trust your
judgment as to what you had seen if
you went alone; and we can&rsquo;t both go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we both went, who would work
the air to let us back in? No, this is
a one-man job and I&rsquo;m the one to do it.
While I am gone, keep a sharp lookout,
and if you see anything unusual call
me at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I call you?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;On this small radio phone. A pair
of receivers tuned to the right wave-length
are in my diving helmet, and I
will be able to hear you although I
can&rsquo;t reply. I won&rsquo;t be gone long:
I have only a small air tank, large
enough to keep me going for thirty
minutes. Now help me into my suit
and keep a sharp watch. A timely
warning may save my life if anything
happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Carnes&rsquo; assistance, Dr. Bird
donned a deep-sea diving outfit and
screwed down the helmet. He crawled
through the inner door into the lock
and lifted the inner door into place.
Carnes fastened the door with nuts
and the Doctor opened a pair of
valves in the outer door and filled the
lock with water. He removed the
outer door; and, taking in one hand
a steel-shod twelve-foot pike with a
hook on the end, and in the other a
waterproof flashlight, he sallied forth.
As he left the shell he paused for a
moment, and then returned and picked
up the heavy wrench with which he
had removed the nuts holding the outer
door into place. He fastened the tool
to the belt of his suit. Then, with a
wave of his hand toward the detective,
he approached the hulk.</p>
<p>The hole in the side was too high
for him to reach, but he hooked the
end of his pike in one of the joints of
the <i>Arethusa&rsquo;s</i> plates and climbed
slowly and painfully up the side of the
vessel. As he disappeared into the
hull, Carnes realized with a sudden
start that he had been watching his
friend and neglecting the duty imposed
on him of keeping a sharp
watch. He turned quickly to the floodlights
and searched the sea bottom.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Nothing</span> appeared, and the minutes
moved as slowly as hours
should. Carnes felt that he had been
submerged alone for weeks, and his
nerves grew so tense that he felt that
he would scream in another instant.
A sudden thought sobered him like a
dash of cold water. If he screamed,
Dr. Bird would take it for an alarm
signal and possibly be afraid to emerge
from the vessel. His watch showed
him that the Doctor had been gone for
twenty-five minutes and he moved
slowly to the radio transmitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Bird,&rdquo; he said slowly and distinctly,
&ldquo;you have been gone nearly
thirty minutes. Nothing alarming has
appeared but I will feel better when I
see you coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glued his eyes on the opening in
the ship&rsquo;s side and waited. Five minutes
passed, and then ten, with no
signs of the Doctor. Carnes moved
again to the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been over half an hour. Doctor,&rdquo;
he cried in a pleading voice. &ldquo;If
you are all right, for God&rsquo;s sake show
yourself. I am frantic with worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another five minutes passed, and the
sweat dripped in a steady stream from
the detective&rsquo;s chin. Suddenly he gave
a sob of relief and sank back against
the side of the globe. A bulky figure
showed at the edge of the hole, and
Dr. Bird climbed slowly and heavily
out of the hold and dropped to the
sea bottom. He lay prone for a moment
before he rose and made his way
with evident effort toward the sphere.
He entered the compartment and with
a heroic effort lifted the outer door
into place, and feebly and with fumbling
fingers placed nuts on the bolts.
His hands wandered uncertainly toward
the valves and closed the upper
one. He waved his hand toward Carnes
and sank in a heap on the floor of the
lock.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>With</span> trembling hands Carnes
connected the air and opened
the valve. Air flowed into the lock
and the water was gradually forced
out. When the lock was empty, he
waited for Dr. Bird to close the outer
valve but the Doctor did not move.
Carnes tore at the bolts which held
the inner door and threw his weight
against it. It held against his assault,
and he thought frantically. An inspiration
came to him, and he disconnected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
the air valve. With a whistling
rush, the air from the lock rushed into
the sphere and he forced open the
inner door. A stream of sea water
drove against his feet through the open
valve, and he reached for the valve to
close it. The force of the water held
it open for a moment, but he threw
every ounce of his strength into the
effort. The valve slowly closed.</p>
<p>It was beyond his strength to haul
the heavy Doctor with his pressure
diving suit through the restricted confines
of the inner door, so Carnes
wormed his way into the lock and with
trembling fingers unscrewed the helmet
of the Doctor&rsquo;s diving suit. The
helmet clanged to the floor and Carnes
scooped up his hands full of water and
dashed it into the Doctor&rsquo;s face. There
was no response and he was at his
wit&rsquo;s end. He sprang for the radio to
order the sphere hauled up when his
glance fell on the oxygen tank. It
took him only a moment to connect a
rubber hose to the tank, and in a few
seconds a blast of the life-giving gas
was blowing into the scientist&rsquo;s face.
Dr. Bird gave a convulsive gasp or
two and opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut off the juice, Carnes,&rdquo; he said
faintly. &ldquo;Too much of that&rsquo;s bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carnes shut off the oxygen and Dr.
Bird struggled to a sitting position
and inhaled deep breaths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a narrow squeak, old
dear,&rdquo; he said faintly. &ldquo;Give me a hand
and I&rsquo;ll climb in.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>With</span> the detective&rsquo;s aid he
climbed into the sphere and
Carnes fastened the inner door. Slowly
the Doctor rid himself of the diving
suit and lay prone on the floor, his
breath still coming in gasps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for your warning about the
time, Carnes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I knew that
my air supply was running short but
I was caught down there and couldn&rsquo;t
readily free myself. I thought for a
while that my time had come, but it
wasn&rsquo;t so written. By the looks of
things, I freed myself just in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find out anything?&rdquo; asked
the detective eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; replied Dr. Bird grimly.
&ldquo;For one thing, the gold is no longer
in the hold of the <i>Arethusa</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clean as a whistle, every bar of it.
A hole has been cut in the vault around
the combination, and the bars slid back
and the door opened. The gold has
been stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might it not have been stolen before
the vessel sank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea occurred to me of course,
and I examined things pretty carefully.
I know that the theft occurred
after the vessel sank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For one thing, the hole was cut
with an under-water cutting torch.
For the second, look here.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> Doctor rolled up his trousers
and showed the detective his leg.
Carnes cried out as he saw huge purple
welts on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What caused that?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I entered the vault, I stepped
full into a steel bear trap which was
set there for the purpose of catching
and holding anyone who entered. Someone
has visited the <i>Arethusa</i>, since she
sank, and looted her, and also arranged
so that any diver who got as far as the
vault would never return to the surface
to tell of it. Luckily for myself, I carried
a heavy wrench and was able to
free myself. Most divers don&rsquo;t carry
such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who could have done it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we have got to find out,
and we aren&rsquo;t going to do it down
here. Give the word to have us hauled
up; and, Carnes, don&rsquo;t mention anything
about the looting of the vessel.
Allow it to be understood that I
couldn&rsquo;t get into the hold. We&rsquo;ll head
back for New York at once. I want to
have a few small changes made in this
sphere before we use it again. While
I am doing that, I want you to get hold
of the Coast Guard or the Immigration
Service or whoever it is that has the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
complete records in that case of alien
smuggling, by the Young Labor party.
When you get the information, report
to me and we&rsquo;ll go over it. You might
also drop a hint to Captain Starley
that will stop all further attempts at
salvage operations for a few days.
Tell him that I&rsquo;ll arrange to have a
Coast Guard cutter guard the locality
of the wreck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that be rather risky for the
cutter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. The gold is gone and
there is no reason to apprehend any
further danger in that locality, at least
for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>At</span> nine o&rsquo;clock next morning Carnes
and Dr. Bird sat in the office
of Lieutenant Commander Minden of
the United States Coast Guard, listening
intently to the history of the alien
smuggling case. Commander Minden
was saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their boats would load up and
clear ostensibly for Rio de Janeiro or
some other South American port, but
once they were in the Atlantic, they
would alter their course and head from
the Massachusetts coast. Of course,
we had no right to interfere with them
on the high seas, and they never came
closer than fifty miles of our coast line.
When they got that close, they would
cruise slowly back and forth for a few
days and then steam away south to the
port they had cleared for. When they
got there, of course there were no passengers
on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We patrolled the coast carefully
while they were around but we never
got any indication of any landing of
aliens and yet we knew they were being
landed in some way. We drew
lines so close that a cork couldn&rsquo;t get
by without being seen and we even had
the air patrolled, but with no results.
Eventually the air patrol was the thing
that gave them away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had been operating so successfully
that they evidently got careless
and started a load off late in the
night so they didn&rsquo;t reach the coast by
dawn. A Navy plane was flying along
the coast-line about twelve miles off
when they spotted a submarine running
parallel with the coast, headed
north. It didn&rsquo;t look like an American
craft and they went on and radioed
Washington and found that we had no
under-sea craft in that neighborhood.
They returned to their patrol and followed
the sub for a matter of thirty
or forty miles up the coast, and then
it turned in right toward the shore.
The shore line there is rocky, and, at
the point where the sub was heading,
it falls sheer about two hundred
fathoms. The sub ran right at the
cliff and disappeared from view.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Lieutenant Commander
Minden</span> paused impressively.
Carnes and Dr. Bird set forward in
their chairs, for it was evident that the
crux of the story was at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the plane reported what they
had seen, we knew how those aliens
were being landed. The point where
the sub went in gave us a good idea of
the location of their base and we threw
a cordon of men around and searched.
A Navy sub was sent to the scene and
they reported that there was a tunnel
opening into the rock, about a hundred
fathoms under water, running for they
had no idea how far under the land.
They stayed to guard the hole while
we combed the land. It took us a week
to locate the place, but we traced some
truck loads of food and finally found
it. This tunnel ran under the land for
a mile and then ended in a large cave
underground. The Young Labor party
had established a regular receiving
depot there, and took the aliens from
the sub and kept them for a day or
two until they had a chance to load
them into trucks and run them into
Boston or some other town in the
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once we had the place spotted, we
sent a gang in and captured the whole
works without any trouble. The underground
cavern had no natural opening
to the surface, but one had been made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
by blasting. We captured the whole
lot and then sealed the end of the hole
with rock and concrete. That was the
end of the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Commander; you have
given us a very graphic description of
it. I suppose you could find the entrance
which was sealed up?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&ldquo;</small><span class='drop'>E</span><span class='dcap'>asily</span>. I led the raiding party.
I forgot to mention one blunder
we made. Evidently some word of
our plans leaked out, for the sub which
was guarding the outer end of the tunnel
was called away by a radio message
supposed to be from the Navy Department.
It had gone only a short distance,
however, when the commander
smelled a rat and made his way back.
He was too late. He was just in time
to see the sub emerge from the hole
and head into the open sea. He gave
chase, but the other sub was faster
than the Navy boat and it got clear
away. The leader of the gang must
have been on it, for we didn&rsquo;t get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was the leader?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From some records we captured, his
name was Ivan Saranoff. I never saw
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saranoff?&rdquo; said Dr. Bird thoughtfully.
&ldquo;The name seems familiar.
Where have I&mdash;Thunder! I know
now. He was at one time a member of
the faculty of St. Petersburg. He was
one of the leading biologists of his
time. Carnes, we&rsquo;ve found our man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are thinking of Saranoff, I
am afraid you are mistaken, Doctor,&rdquo;
said Commander Minden. &ldquo;Neither he
nor his submarine have ever been heard
of since and it has been generally conceded
that they were lost at sea. We
had some pretty rough weather just
after that affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rough weather doesn&rsquo;t mean much
to a sub, Commander. I expect that
he&rsquo;s our man. At any rate, the place
we want to go is the end of that
tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m at your service, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carnes, get the location of that tunnel
entrance from Commander Minden
and order the <i>Minneconsin</i> to proceed
north along the coast to that vicinity
and stand by for radio orders. I am
going to telephone Mitchell Field and
get a plane. We have no time to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> plane from Mitchell Field
roared down to a landing, and
Carnes, Dr. Bird and Commander Minden
dismounted from the rear cockpit
and looked around. They had landed
in a smooth field at the base of a rise
almost rugged enough to be called a
mountain. A group of three men were
standing near them as they got out of
the plane. One of the men approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Bird?&rdquo; asked the newcomer.
&ldquo;I am Tom Harron, United States
Marshal. These two men are deputies.
I understand that I am to report to
you for orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to know you, Mr. Harron.
This is Operative Carnes of the Secret
Service and Commander Minden of the
Coast Guard. We are going to explore
an underground cavern that is located
in this vicinity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the one where they
used to smuggle aliens? That is closed
up. I was in charge of that work and
we closed it tight as a drum two years
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you find the entrance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. It isn&rsquo;t over a mile from
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead the way, then. We want to
take a look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The marshal led the way toward the
eminence and took a path which led
up a gully in its side. He paused for
a moment to take his bearings and then
turned sharply to his left and climbed
part way up the side of the ravine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; he announced. An expression
of astonishment crossed his
face and he examined the ground
closely. &ldquo;By Golly, Doc,&rdquo; he went on
as he straightened up, &ldquo;this place has
been opened since I left it!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Dr. Bird</span> hurried forward and
joined him. The heavy stone and
concrete with which the entrance to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
the cavern had been sealed were undisturbed,
but in the side of the hill was
set a steel door beside the concrete.
There was no sign of a keyhole or
other means of entering it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was this steel door part of your
work?&rdquo; asked Carnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, it wasn&rsquo;t. We sealed it
solid. That door has been put there
since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Bird closely examined the structure.
He tapped it and went around
the edges and then straightened up
and took a small pocket compass from
his pocket and opened the case. The
needle swung crazily for a moment and
then pointed straight toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A magnetic lock,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;If we could find the power line it
would be easy to force, but finding that
line might take us a week. At any
rate, we have found out what we were
after. This is their base from which
they are operating. Mr. Harron, I
want you to station a guard armed
with rifles at this door day and night
until I personally relieve you. Remember,
until I relieve you, in person.
Verbal or written orders don&rsquo;t go.
Capture or kill anyone who tries to
enter or leave the cavern through this
entrance. Just now we&rsquo;ll find that cavern
more vulnerable from the sea end,
and that is where I mean to attack.
We&rsquo;ll force that door and explore from
this end later. Commander Minden,
you may stay here with Mr. Harron,
if you like, or you may come with
Carnes and me. We are going on board
the <i>Minneconsin</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> Mitchell Field plane roared
to a take-off and bore south along
the coast. Half an hour of flying
brought them in view of the battleship
steaming at full speed up the coast.
Dr. Bird radioed instructions to the
ship, and an hour later a launch picked
them up from the beach and took them
out. As soon as they were on board
they resumed their progress, and in
two hours the peak that Dr. Bird had
marked as a landmark was opposite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steam in as close to the shore as
you can safely,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and then
lower us. Once we are down, you will
be guided by our telephoned instructions.
Come on, Carnes, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective followed him into the
sphere as the <i>Minneconsin</i> edged up
toward the shore. The huge ball was
lifted from the deck and lowered gently
into two hundred fathoms of water.
It was pitch dark at that depth, and
Dr. Bird switched on one floodlight
and studied the cliff which rose a hundred
yards from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have missed the place, Carnes,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have them pull us up
a few hundred feet and then steam
along the coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the telephone and the
sphere rose while the battleship
steamed slowly ahead, the vitrilene
ball following in her wake. For a
quarter of a mile they continued on
their way, and then Dr. Bird halted
the ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What depth are we?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Eighty fathoms? All right, lower us,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> ball sank until it rested on the
sea bottom, and Dr. Bird turned on
two additional floodlights and studied
the surroundings. The bed of the
ocean was literally covered with lobster
and crab shell, with the bones of fish
scattered here and there among them.
A few bones of land animals were
mixed with the debris and Carnes gave
a gasp as Dr. Bird pointed out to him a
diving helmet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are on the right track,&rdquo; said the
scientist grimly. He stepped to the
telephone and ordered the sphere
raised to one hundred fathoms. The
ship moved forward along the coast
until Dr. Bird again stepped to the
telephone and halted it. Before them
yawned the entrance to the underground
tunnel. It was about two hundred
feet high and three hundred
across, and their most powerful beams
would not penetrate to the end of it.
A pile of debris could be seen on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
floor of the tunnel and Carnes fancied
that he could see another diving helmet
among the litter. Dr. Bird pointed
toward the side of the cavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See those floodlights fastened to
the cliff so that their beams will sweep
across the mouth of the tunnel when
they are lighted?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Apparently
the cave is used as a prison and
the light beams are the bars. The
creature is not at home just now or
the bars would be up. My God! Look
at that, Carnes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carnes stared and echoed the Doctor&rsquo;s
cry of surprise. Clinging to a
shelf of rock which extended out from
the wall of the cavern and half hidden
among the seaweed was a huge marine
creature. It looked like a huge black
slug with rudimentary eyes and mouth.
The thing was fifty feet in length and
fully fifteen feet in diameter. It hung
there, moving sluggishly as though
breathing, and rudimentary tentacles
projecting from one end moved in the
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Doctor?&rdquo; asked Carnes
in a voice of awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a typical trochosphere of the
giant octopus, the devil fish of Indian
Ocean legend, multiplied a thousand
times,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;When the octopus
lays its eggs, they hatch out into the
larval form. The free swimming larva
is known as a trochosphere, and I am
positive that that is what we see; but
look at the size of the thing! Man
alive, if that ever developed, I can&rsquo;t
conceive of its dimensions!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcapq'><small>&ldquo;</small><span class='drop'>I</span><span class='dcap'> have</span> seen pictures of a huge
octopus pulling down a ship,&rdquo;
said Carnes, &ldquo;but I always fancied they
were imaginary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are. This monstrosity before
us is no product of nature. A dozen
of them would depopulate the seas in
a year. It is a hideous parody of
nature conceived in the brain of a madman
and produced by some glandular
disturbance. Saranoff spent years in
glandular experimentation, and no
doubt he has managed to stimulate the
thyroid of a normal octopus and produce
a giant. I fancy that the immediate
parent of the thing before us
was of normal size, and so, probably,
are its brothers and sisters. The
phenomenon of giantism of this nature
occurs in alternate generations and
then only in rare instances. Its grandparent
may not be far away, however.
I wish it was safe to use a submarine
to explore that cavern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any creature powerful enough to
pull the <i>Arethusa</i> under water would
crush a frail submarine without effort.
Anyway, a Navy sub isn&rsquo;t built for
under-water exploration like this ball
is. The window space is quite limited
and they aren&rsquo;t equipped with powerful
floodlights. I would like to be able
to reach that thing and destroy it, but
it can wait until later. The best thing
we can do is to put out our lights and
wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hand sought the light switch,
and the globe became dark. Only a
tiny glimmer of light came down to
them from the surface, a hundred
fathoms above. In the darkness they
stared into the depths of the sea.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>For</span> an hour they waited and then
Dr. Bird grasped Carnes by the
shoulder and pointed. Far in the distance
could be seen a tiny point of
light. It wavered and winked and at
times disappeared, but it was gradually
approaching them. Dr. Bird stepped
to the telephone and the <i>Minneconsin</i>
moved a hundred yards further from
the shore. The light disappeared again
as though hidden by some opaque body.
Their eyes had become accustomed to
the dim light and they could dimly see
a long snake-like body approach the
globe and then suddenly withdraw.</p>
<p>The light appeared again only a few
hundred yards away. The water
swirled and the sphere swayed drunkenly
as some gigantic body moved past
it with express train speed and entered
the mouth of the cavern. The light
turned toward them and they could see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
the dim outlines of a small submarine
on which it was mounted. Another
rush of water came as the object which
had entered the cave started to leave it,
and the light swung around. It bore
on a huge black body, and was reflected
with a red glow from huge eyes, and
the creature backed again into the cave.
Back and forth across the mouth of the
cavern the light played, and the watchers
caught a glimpse of a huge parrot
beak which could have engulfed a
freight car. From the cavern projected
twisting tentacles of gargantuan dimensions,
and red eyes, thirty feet in
diameter, glared balefully at them. For
several minutes the light of the submarine
played across the mouth of the
cave, and then the floodlights on the
cliff sprang into full glow and bathed
the ball and the mouth of the tunnel in
a flood of light.</p>
<p>Before their horrified gaze was an
octopus of a size to make them disbelieve
their eyes. The submarine had
moved up to within a few feet of them,
and the light from it played full on the
ball. The submarine maneuvered in
the vicinity, keeping the ball full in
the beam of its light, and then drew
back. As it did so, the floodlights on
the cliff died out and the beam of the
submarine&rsquo;s light was directed away
from them. Dr. Bird jumped to the
telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Head straight out to sea and full
speed ahead!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try
to pull us in; tow us!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> ball swayed as the <i>Minneconsin&rsquo;s</i>
mighty engines responded to
his orders and the cliff wall disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as they know we&rsquo;re here, we
might as well announce our presence
in good style,&rdquo; said the doctor grimly
as he closed a switch and threw all of
the sphere&rsquo;s huge lights into action.
He had turned on the lights just in
time, for even as he did so a mighty
tentacle shot out of the darkness and
wrapped itself around the ball. For a
moment it clung there and then was
withdrawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing can&rsquo;t stand light,&rdquo; remarked
the doctor as he threw off the
switch. &ldquo;That sub was herding it like
a cow by the use of a light beam. As
long as we are lighted up we are safe
from attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then for God&rsquo;s sake turn on the
lights!&rdquo; cried Carnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want it to attack us,&rdquo; replied the
doctor calmly. &ldquo;We have no offensive
weapons and only by meeting an attack
can we harm the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke there came a soft whisper
of sound from the vitrilene walls
and they were thrown from their feet
by a sudden jerk. Dr. Bird stumbled
to the switch and closed it, and the ball
was flooded with light. Two arms were
now on them but they were slowly
withdrawn as the lights glared forth.
The huge outlines of the beast could be
seen as it followed them toward the
surface. Its great eyes glared at them
hungrily. The submarine was visible
only as a speck of light in the distance.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> <i>Minneconsin&rsquo;s</i> speed was picking
up under the urge of her huge
steam turbines, and the ball was nearing
the surface. The sea was light
enough now that they could see for
quite a distance. The telephone bell
jangled and Dr. Bird picked the receiver
from its hook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? You
can? By all means, fire. Yes, indeed,
we&rsquo;re well out of danger; we must be
thirty or forty feet down. Watch the
fun now,&rdquo; he went on to Carnes as
he replaced the receiver. &ldquo;The beast is
showing above the surface and they&rsquo;re
going to shell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They watched the surface and suddenly
there came a flash of light followed
by a dull boom of sound. The
huge octopus suddenly sank below
them, thrashing its arms about wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hit!&rdquo; shouted Dr. Bird into the
telephone. &ldquo;Get it again if it shows
up. I want it to get good and mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned off the lights in the ball
and the octopus attacked again. The
shell had taught it caution and it kept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
well down, but three huge arms came
up from the depths of the sea and
wrapped themselves about the ball. The
forward motion stopped for a moment,
and then came a jerk that threw them
down. The ball started to sink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our cable has parted!&rdquo; cried the
doctor. &ldquo;Turn on the lights!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Carnes</span> closed the switch. The
ball was so covered with the huge
tentacles that they could see nothing,
but the light had its usual effect and
they were released. The ball sank toward
the bottom and they could see the
huge cephalopod lying below watching
them. Blood was flowing from a wound
near one of its eyes where the <i>Minneconsin&rsquo;s</i>
shell had found its mark.</p>
<p>Toward the huge monster they sank
until they lay on the bottom of the
ocean and a few yards from it. In an
instant the sea became opaque and they
could see nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has shot his ink!&rdquo; cried the doctor.
&ldquo;Here comes the real attack. Strap
yourself to the wall where you can
reach one of the motor switches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the darkness huge arms
came out and wrapped themselves
around the ball. The heavy vitrilene
groaned under the enormous pressure
which was applied, but it held. The
ink was clearing slightly and they
could see that the sphere was covered
by the arms. The mass moved and the
huge maw opened before them. The
pipes projecting from the sides of the
ball were buried in the creature&rsquo;s flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord, he&rsquo;s going to swallow
us!&rdquo; gasped the doctor. &ldquo;Quick, Carnes,
the motor switch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He closed one of them as he spoke,
and the powerful little electric motors
began to hum, forcing forward the piston
attached to the tank connected to
the hollow rods. Steadily the little
motors hummed, and the tank emptied
through the rods into the body of the
giant cephalopod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the stuff works fast,&rdquo;
groaned the doctor as they approached
closer to the giant maw. &ldquo;I never tried
giving an octopus a hypodermic injection
of prussic acid before, but it ought
to do the business. There&rsquo;s enough
acid there to kill half New York City.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Carnes</span> blanched as the ball approached
the mouth. One by one
the arms unwound until only one was
holding them and the jaws opened
wider. They were almost in them when
the motion stopped. They could feel a
shudder run through the arm which
held them. For a moment the arm
alternately expanded and contracted,
almost releasing them only to clutch
them again. Another arm came from
the depths and whipped about the ball,
and again the vitrilene groaned at the
pressure which was applied. The arms
were suddenly withdrawn and the ball
started to sink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop the lead, Carnes!&rdquo; cried the
doctor. With the aid of the detective
he operated the electric catches which
held the huge mass of lead to the bottom,
and the sphere shot up through
the water like a rocket. It leaped clear
of the water and fell back with a
splash. A half mile away the <i>Minneconsin</i>
was swinging in a wide circle
to head back toward them. They turned
their gaze toward the shore.</p>
<p>As they looked a giant arm shot a
hundred yards up into the air, twisting
and writhing frantically. It disappeared,
and another, and then half a
dozen flashed into the air. The arms
dipped below the surface. A huge
black body reared its bulk free from
the water for a moment, and the sea
boiled as though in a violent storm.
The body sank and again the arms were
thrown up, twisting and turning like a
half dozen huge snakes. The whole
creature sank below the waves and the
ball tossed back and forth, often buried
under tons of water and once tossed
thirty feet into the air by the huge
waves.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>A momentary</span> lull came in the
waves. Carnes gave a cry of
astonishment and pointed toward the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
shore. With an effort, Dr. Bird twisted
himself in his lashing and looked in
that direction. The huge body had
again come to the surface, and three of
the arms were towering into the air.
Grasped in them was a long, black,
cigar-shaped object. As they watched
the object was torn into two parts and
the fragments crushed by the enormous
power of the octopus. Again the arms
writhed in torment, and then they stiffened
out. For a moment they towered
in the air and then slowly sank below
the surface of the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cyanide has worked,&rdquo; cried the
doctor, &ldquo;and in its last agonies the creature
has turned on its creator and destroyed
him. It is a shame, for Saranoff
was a brilliant although perverted
genius, and besides, I would have liked
to have learned his method. However,
I may find something when we open the
land end and raid the cave; and really,
he was too brilliant a man to hang for
murder. Once we open the cave and I
get any data that is there, my connection
with the case will end. Trailing
down the gold and recovering it is a
routine matter for Bolton, and one in
which he won&rsquo;t need my help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about that creature we saw in
the cave, Doctor? Won&rsquo;t it hatch into
another terror of the sea like the thing
that destroyed the ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trochosphere? No, I&rsquo;m not worried
there. It won&rsquo;t try to leave the
cave for some days yet, and by that
time we&rsquo;ll have the land end opened
and the floodlights turned on. They
will keep it there and it will starve to
death. We could send down a sub to
feed it a torpedo, but there&rsquo;s no need.
Nature will dispose of it. Meanwhile,
I hope the <i>Minneconsin</i> rigs up a jury
tackle pretty soon and takes us on
board. I&rsquo;m getting seasick.&rdquo;</p>

</p>
</div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Beneath</span> the huge central arch
in Cooper Square a meeting
was in progress&mdash;a gathering
of the gray-clad workers of the
lower levels of New York. Less than
two hundred of their number were in
evidence, and these huddled in dejected
groups
around the pedestal
from which a
fiery-tongued orator
was addressing
them. Lounging negligently at the
edge of the small crowd were a dozen
of the red police.</p>
<p class='sidebarright'>The blood of the Van Dorn&rsquo;s ran in Karl&rsquo;s
veins. He rode the skies like an avenging
god.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, comrades,&rdquo; the speaker
was shouting, &ldquo;the time has come when
we must revolt. We must battle to the
death with the wearers of the purple.
Why work out
our lives down
here so they can
live in the lap of
luxury over our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
heads? Why labor day after day at
the oxygen generators to give them the
fresh air they breathe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker paused uncertainly as a
chorus of raucous laughter came to his
ears. He glared belligerently at a
group of newcomers who stood aloof
from his own gathering. Seven or
eight of them there were, and they
wore the gray with obvious discomfort.
Slummers! Well, they&rsquo;d hear something
they could carry back with them
when they returned to their homes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he continued in rising tones,
&ldquo;do we sit at the controls of the pneumatic
tubes which carry thousands of
our fellows to tasks equally irksome,
while they of the purple ride their air
yachts to the pleasure cities of the sky
lanes? Never in the history of mankind
have the poor been poorer and the
rich richer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah!&rdquo; shouted a disrespectful voice
from among the newcomers. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
full o&rsquo; bunk! Nothing but bunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An ominous murmur swelled from
the crowd and the red police roused
from their lethargy. The mounting
scream of a siren echoed in the vaulted
recesses above and re-echoed from the
surrounding columns&mdash;the call for
reserves.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>All</span> was confusion in the Square.
The little group of newcomers
immediately became the center of a
mêlée of dangerous proportions. Some
of the more timid of the wearers of the
gray struggled to get out of the crowd
and away. Others, not in sympathy
with the speaker, rushed to the support
of the besieged visitors. The police
were, for the moment, overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The orator, mad with resentment and
injured pride, hurled himself into the
group. A knife flashed in his hand;
rose and fell. A scream of agony
shrilled piercingly above the din of
the fighting.</p>
<p>Then came the reserves, and the
wielder of the knife turned to escape.
He broke away from the milling combatants
and made speedily for the
shadows that lay beyond the great pillars
of the Square. But he never
reached them, for one of the red guards
raised his riot pistol and fired. There
was a dull <i>plop</i>, and a rubbery something
struck the fleeing man and
wrapped powerful tentacles around his
body, binding him hand and foot in
their swift embrace. He fell crashing
to the pavement.</p>
<p>A lieutenant of the red police was
shouting his orders and the din in the
Square was deafening. With their
numbers greatly augmented, the guards
were now in control of the situation
and their maces struck left and right.
Groans and curses came from the gray-clad
workers, who now fought desperately
to escape.</p>
<p>Then, with startling suddenness, the
artificial sunlight of the cavernous
Square was gone, leaving the battle to
continue in utter darkness.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Cooper Square</span>, in the year
2108, was the one gathering place
in New York City where the wearers
of the gray denim were permitted to
assemble and discuss their grievances
publicly. Deep in the maze of lower-level
ways seldom visited by wearers
of the purple, the grottolike enclosure
bore the name of a philanthropist of
the late nineteenth century and still
carried a musty air of certain of the
traditions of that period.</p>
<p>In Astor Way, on the lowest level of
all, there was a tiny book shop.
Nestled between two of the great columns
that provided foundation support
for the eighty levels above, it was
safely hidden from the gaze of curious
passersby in the Square. Slumming
parties from afar, their purple temporarily
discarded for the gray, occasionally
passed within a stone&rsquo;s throw of
the little shop, never suspecting the
existence of such a retreat amidst the
dark shadows of the pillars. But to
the initiated few amongst the wearers
of the gray, and to certain of the red
police, it was well known.</p>
<p>Rudolph Krassin, proprietor of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
establishment, was a bent and withered
ancient. His jacket of gray denim
hung loosely from his spare frame and
his hollow cough bespoke a deep-seated
ailment. Looking out from behind
thick lenses set in his square-rimmed
spectacles, the watery eyes seemed vacant;
uncomprehending. But old Rudolph
was a scholar&mdash;keen-witted&mdash;and
a gentleman besides. To his many
friends of the gray-clad multitude he
was an anomaly; they could not understand
his devotion to his well-thumbed
volumes. But they listened
to his words of wisdom and, more frequently
than they could afford, parted
with precious labor tickets in exchange
for reading matter that was usually of
the lighter variety.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>When</span> the fighting started in the
Square, Rudolph was watching
and listening from a point of vantage
in the shadows near his shop. This
fellow Leontardo, who was the speaker,
was an agitator of the worst sort. His
arguments always were calculated to
arouse the passions of his hearers; to
inflame them against the wearers of the
purple. He had nothing constructive
to offer. Always he spoke of destruction;
war; bloodshed. Rudolph marveled
at the patience of the red police.
To-day, these newcomers, obviously a
slumming party of youngsters bent on
whatever mischief they could find, were
interfering with the speaker. The old
man chuckled at the first interruption.
But at signs of real trouble he scurried
into the shadows and vanished in the
blackness of first-level passages known
only to himself. He knew where to
find the automatic sub-station of the
Power Syndicate.</p>
<p>Returning to the darkness he had
created in the Square, he was relieved
to find that the sounds of the fighting
had subsided. Apparently most of the
wearers of the gray had escaped. He
skirted the avenue of pillars along Astor
Way, feeling his way from one to
another as he progressed toward his
little shop. Peering into the blackness
of the square he saw the feeble beams
of several flash-lamps in the hands of
the police. They were searching for
survivors of the fracas, maces and riot
pistols held ready for use. A sobbing
gasp from close by set his pulses throbbing.
He crept stealthily in the direction
from which the sound had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady now,&rdquo; came a whispered
voice. &ldquo;My uncle&rsquo;s shop is close by.
He&rsquo;ll take you in. Here&mdash;let me lift
you.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>There</span> was a shuffling on the opposite
side of the pillar at which
Rudolph had halted; another grunt of
pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Karl!&rdquo; hissed the old man. It was
his nephew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Rudolph?&rdquo; came the guarded
response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Can I help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick&mdash;yes&mdash;he&rsquo;s fainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man was around the huge
base of the column in an instant. He
groped in the darkness and his hands
encountered human bodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the hecklers, Uncle. A
young lad; and of the purple I think.
He&rsquo;s been knifed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they dragged the inert
form into the shelter of the long line
of pillars. There was a trampling of
many men in the square. That would
be a second detachment of reserves. A
ray of light filtered through and dancing
shadows of the giant columns made
grotesque outlines against the walls of
the Way. A portable searchlight had
been brought to the scene. They must
hurry.</p>
<p>Impeded by the dead weight of their
burden, they made sorry progress and
several times found it necessary to halt
in the shadow of a pillar while the red
police passed by in their search of the
Square. It was with a sigh of relief
that Rudolph opened the door of his
shop and with still greater satisfaction
closed and bolted it securely. His
nephew shouldered the limp form of
the unconscious youth and carried it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
to his own bed in one of the rear rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; exclaimed old Rudolph as he
ripped open the young man&rsquo;s shirt, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
a nasty cut. Warm water, Karl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gaping wound was washed and
bound tightly. Rudolph&rsquo;s experienced
fingers told him the knife had not
reached a vital spot. The youth would
recover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Karl,&rdquo; he objected, &ldquo;he wears
the purple. Under the gray. See! It&rsquo;ll
get us in trouble if we keep him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was stripping the young man of
his clothing to prepare him for bed.
Suddenly there was revealed on the
white skin a triangular mark. Bright
scarlet it was and just over the right
hip. He made a hasty attempt to hide
it from the watching eyes of Karl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle!&rdquo; snapped his nephew, &ldquo;&mdash;the
mark you call cursed! He has it, too!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> tall young man in gray was on
his knees, tearing the hands of the
old man away. He saw the mark clearly
now. There was no further use of
attempting to conceal it. Rudolph rose
and faced his angered nephew, his
watery eyes inscrutable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me, Rudolph, that it was
a brand that cursed me. I have seen
it on him, too. You have lied to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s eyes wavered. He
trembled violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you lie?&rdquo; demanded Karl.
&ldquo;Am I not your nephew? Am I not
really cursed as you&rsquo;ve maintained?
Tell me&mdash;tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had the old man by the shoulders,
shaking him cruelly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Karl&mdash;Karl,&rdquo; begged the helpless
ancient, &ldquo;it was for your good. I swear
it. You were born to the purple. That&rsquo;s
what that mark means&mdash;not that you&rsquo;re
degraded to the gray, as I said. But
there&rsquo;s a reason. Let me explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! A reason! You&rsquo;ve kept me
in this misery and squalor for a reason!
Who&rsquo;s my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung Rudolph to the floor, where
the old man crouched in apprehensive
misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please Karl&mdash;don&rsquo;t! I can explain.
Just give me time. It&rsquo;s a long story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time! Time! For twenty-odd
years you&rsquo;ve lied to me; cheated me.
My birthright&mdash;where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He menaced his supposed uncle; was
about to strike him. Then suddenly
he was ashamed. He turned on his
heel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving,&rdquo; he said shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Karl&mdash;my boy,&rdquo; begged Rudolph
Krassin, struggling to his feet. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t! That lad in there&mdash;he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Karl was too angry to reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hell with him!&rdquo; he raged, &ldquo;and
to hell with you! I&rsquo;m through!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stamped from the room and out
into the eery shadows of the Way.
Karl was done with his old life. He&rsquo;d
go to the upper levels and claim his
rights. Some day, too, he&rsquo;d punish the
man who&rsquo;d stolen them away. God!
Born to the purple! To think he&rsquo;d
missed it all! Probably was kidnaped
by the old rascal he&rsquo;d been calling uncle.
But he&rsquo;d find out. Rudolph didn&rsquo;t
have to explain. Fingerprint records
would clear his name; establish his
rightful station in life. He dived into
a passage that would lead him to one
of the express lifts. He&rsquo;d soon be
overhead.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>A sergeant</span> of the red police
looked up startled from his desk
as a tall youth in the gray denim of
forty levels below appeared before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he growled. The stalwart
young worker had stared belligerently
and insolently, he thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to check my fingerprint record,
Sergeant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm. Pretty cocky, aren&rsquo;t you?
The records for such as you are down
below, where you belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not mine, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So? And who the devil are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here to find out.
I&rsquo;ve got a triangle branded on my right
hip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Triangle. Here&mdash;look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The amazing youngster had raised
his jacket and was pulling at his shirt.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
The sergeant stared at what was revealed,
his eyes bulging as he looked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;a Van Dorn&mdash;in
the gray!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly he turned to the radiovision
and made rapid connection with several
persons in turn&mdash;important ones,
by the appearance of the features of
each in the brilliant disc of the instrument.</p>
<p>Karl was confused by the sudden
turn of things. The sergeant talked
so rapidly he could not catch the sense
of his words. And that name, Van
Dorn, eluded him. He knew he had
heard it before, in the little shop down
there in Astor Way. But he could not
place it. He wished fervently that he
had paid more attention to the desires
of old Rudolph; had studied more and
read the books the old man had begged
him to read. His new surroundings
confused him, too, and he knew that
he was the center of some great new
excitement.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Then</span> they were in the room; two
individuals, one in the red uniform
of a captain of police, the other a
pompous, whiskered man in purple.
Others followed and it seemed to Karl
that the room was filled with them,
strangers all, and they stared at him
and chattered incessantly. He experienced
an overwhelming impulse to run,
but mastered it and faced them boldly.</p>
<p>A square of plate glass was placed
under his outstretched fingers. It was
smeared with something sticky and he
watched the whiskered man as he held
it up to the light and studied the impressions.
Then there was more confusion.
Everyone talked at once and the
pompous one in purple made use of
the radiovision, holding the square of
glass near its disc for observation by
the person he had called. The identification
number was repeated aloud, a
string of figures and letters that were
a meaningless jumble to Karl. The
room became quiet while the police
captain thumbed the pages of a huge
book he had taken from among many
similar ones that filled a rack behind
the desk.</p>
<p>Karl&rsquo;s blood froze in his veins at the
rumbling swish of a car speeding
through the pneumatic tube beneath
their feet. His nerves were on edge.
Then the captain of police looked up
from the book and there was a peculiar
glint in his eyes as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Van Dorn. Missing since
2085. Wanted by Continental Government.
Ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words came to Karl&rsquo;s ears
through a growing sensation of unreality.
It seemed that the speaker was
miles away and that his voice and features
were those of a radiovision likeness.
Wanted by the great power
across the Atlantic! It was unthinkable.
Why, he had been but an infant
in 2085! What possible crime could he
have committed? But the red police
captain was speaking again, this time
in a chill voice. And the room of the
police, thick with the smoke of a dozen
cigars, became suddenly stifling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been these twenty-three
years, Peter Van Dorn?&rdquo; asked
the captain. &ldquo;Who have you lived
with, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Something</span> warned him to protect
old Rudolph. And somehow
he wished he had not treated the old
fellow as he did when he left. His
self-possession returned. A wave of
hot resentment swept over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my affair,&rdquo; he said defiantly.</p>
<p>The captain shrugged his shoulders.
&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t answer&mdash;now.
We&rsquo;ll find out when it&rsquo;s
necessary. In the meanwhile we&rsquo;ll
have to turn you over to the Continental
Ambassador.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of the red police advanced toward
him and the rest drew back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean I&rsquo;m under arrest?&rdquo; asked
Karl incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Of course you&rsquo;re not to
be harmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the guards had him by the
arm and he saw the glint of handcuffs.
They couldn&rsquo;t do this! If it had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
for rioting in the Square it would be
different. But this! It meant he was
a prisoner of a foreign government,
for what reason he could not guess.
He lost his head completely.</p>
<p>The captain cried out in amazement
as one of his huskiest guards went
sprawling under a well-planted punch.
This youngster must be as crazy as
was his father before him. But he was
a whirlwind. Before he could be
stopped he had tackled the other guard
and with a mighty heave flung him
halfway across the room where he fell
with a thud that left him dazed and
gasping. The pompous little man in
the purple crawled under the desk as
the sergeant leveled a slender tube at
the young giant in gray.</p>
<p>Karl ducked instinctively at sight of
the weapon, but the spiteful crackle of
its mechanism was too quick for him.
A faintly luminous ray struck him full
in the breast and stopped him in his
tracks. A thrill of intense cold chased
up his spine and a thunderbolt crashed
in his brain. The captain caught his
stiffened body as he fell.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Karl</span>&mdash;refusing to think of himself
as Peter Van Dorn&mdash;came to
his senses as from a troubled sleep.
His head ached miserably and he
turned it slowly to view his surroundings.
Then, in a flash, he remembered.
The paralyzing ray of the red police!
They never used it in the lower levels;
but overhead&mdash;why, the swine! He sat
suddenly erect and glared into a pair
of green eyes that regarded him
curiously.</p>
<p>A quick glance showed him that he
was in a small padded compartment
like that of the pneumatic tube cars.
At one end there was an amazing array
of machinery with glittering levers
and handwheels&mdash;a control board on
which numberless tiny lights blinked
and flickered in rapid succession. At
these controls squatted the twisted figure
of a dwarf. A second of the creatures
sat at his side and stared with
those horrible green eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Am I still
asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; smiled the dwarf, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
awake, Peter Van Dorn.&rdquo; The misshapen
creature did not seem unfriendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where am I, and who are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in one of the Zar&rsquo;s rocket
cars, speeding toward Dorn. We are
but two of the Zar&rsquo;s servants&mdash;Moon
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rocket car? Moon men?&rdquo; Karl was
aghast. He wanted to pinch himself.
But a hollow roar to the rear told him
he was in a rapidly moving vessel of
some sort. Certainly, too, these dwarfs
were not figments of his imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been kept completely ignorant?&rdquo;
asked the dwarf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it seems so.&rdquo; Karl was bewildered.
&ldquo;You mean we are out in the
open&mdash;traveling in space&mdash;to the Moon
perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> dwarf laughed. &ldquo;No, I wish
we were,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But we are
about halfway to the capital of the
Continental Empire, greatest of world
powers. We&rsquo;ll be there in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupid. Didn&rsquo;t you ever hear of the
rocket ships that cross the ocean like
a projectile, mounting a thousand miles
from the surface and making the trip
in two hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Karl was aghast. &ldquo;Are we
really in such a contraption?&rdquo; he faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! Are you kidding me?&rdquo; The
dwarf was incredulous. &ldquo;Do you mean
to tell me you know so little of your
world as that? Have you never read
anything? The news broadcasts, the
thought exchangers&mdash;don&rsquo;t you follow
them at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Karl shook his head in growing wonder.
Truly Rudolph had kept him in
ignorance. Or was it his own fault?
He had refused to dig into the volumes
old Krassin had begged him to read.
The broadcasts and the thought machines&mdash;well,
only those of the purple
had access to those.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Laro!&rdquo; called the dwarf to his
companion, &ldquo;this mole is as dumb as
can be. Doesn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s alive hardly.
And a Van Dorn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two laughed uproariously and
Karl raged inwardly. Mole! So that&rsquo;s
what they called wearers of the gray!
He clenched his fists and rose unsteadily
to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; apologized his tormentor.
&ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t get sore now. It seems so
funny to us though. And listen, kid,
you&rsquo;ll never have another chance to
hear it all. So, if you&rsquo;ll sit down and
calm yourself a bit I&rsquo;ll give you an
earful.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Mollified</span>, Karl listened. A
marvelous tale it was, of a disgruntled
scientist of the Eastern Hemisphere
who had conquered that portion
of the world with the aid of the inhabitants
he had found on the outer
side of the Moon; of the scientist who
still ruled the East&mdash;Zar of the Continental
Empire. A horrible war&mdash;in
2085, the year of his own birth&mdash;depopulated
the countries of Asia, Europe
and Africa and reduced them to
subjection. There was no combatting
the destructive rays and chemical warfare
of the Moon men. The United
Americas, still weakened from a civil
war of their own, remained aloof and,
for some strange reason, the Zar left
them in peace, contenting himself with
his conquest of practically all of the
rest of the world. Now, it seemed, the
two major powers were as separate as
if on different planets, there being no
traffic between them save by governmental
sanction; and that was rarely
given.</p>
<p>It grew uncomfortably warm in the
compartment as the rocket car entered
the lower atmosphere but Karl listened
spellbound to the astounding revelations
of the Moon man. There came
a pause in the discourse of the dwarf
as a number of relays clicked furiously
on the control board and the vessel
slackened its speed perceptibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Karl, thinking aloud
rather than meaning to interrupt,
&ldquo;what has all this to do with me? Why
does the government of this Zar want
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dwarf bent close and eyed him
cautiously. &ldquo;Poor kid!&rdquo; he whispered,
&ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t seem right that you should
suffer for something that happened
when you were born; something you
know nothing about. But the Zar
knows best. You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came a stabbing pencil of
light from over Karl&rsquo;s shoulder and
the green eyes of the dwarf went wide
with horrified surprise. He clutched
at his breast where the flame had contacted,
then slowly collapsed in a pitiful,
distorted heap. Karl recoiled from
the odor of putrefaction that immediately
filled the compartment. He
whirled to face the new danger but saw
nothing but the padded walls.</p>
<p>Then they were in darkness save for
the blinking lights of the control board.
He was thrown forward violently and
the piercing screech of compressed air
rushing past the vessel told him they
had entered the receiving tube at their
destination and were being retarded
in speed for the landing. This much
he had gathered from the explanations
of the now silenced dwarf.</p>
<p>Laro, the other Moon man, remained
mute at the controls. His companion
evidently had talked too much.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> vessel had stopped and a section
of the padded rear wall of the
compartment moved back to reveal a
second chamber. There were three
other occupants of the ship and Karl
knew now at whose hands the talkative
Moon man had met his death. One of
the three&mdash;all wearers of the purple&mdash;still
held the generator of the dazzling
ray in his hands. He decided wisely
that resistance was useless and followed
meekly when he was led from
the ship.</p>
<p>Endlessly they rode upward in a
high-speed lift, dismounting finally at
a pneumatic tube entrance. A special
car whisked them roaring into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
blackness. Then they were shot forth
into the open and Karl saw the light of
the sun for the first time in many years.
They were on the upper surface of a
great city, Dorn, the capital of the Continental
Empire.</p>
<p>The air was filled with darting ships
of all sorts and sizes, most of them being
pleasure craft of the wearers of the
purple. To Karl it was the sudden
realization of his dreams. He was one
of them. He, too, should be wearing
the purple. Then his heart sank as
one of his guards prodded him into
action. His dream already was shattered
for they stood at the entrance to
a great crystal pyramid that rose from
the flat expanse of the roofs of Dorn.
It was the palace of the Zar.</p>
<p>It seemed then that fairyland had
opened its gates to the young man in
gray denim. He immediately fell under
its influence when they traversed
a long lane between rows of brightly
colored growing things which filled
the air with sweet odors. Feathered
creatures fluttered about and twittered
and caroled in the sheer joy of being
alive. It was sweeter music than he
had ever believed possible or even
imagined as existing. Again he forgot
the menace of the imperial edict which
had brought him from the other side
of the world.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Then</span> rudely, he was brought back
to earth. He was in the presence of
the mighty Zar and his three escorts
were bowing themselves from the huge
room in which the wizened monarch
sat enthroned. They had finished their
duties.</p>
<p>A shriveled face; beady eyes; trembling
hands with abnormally large
knuckles; a cruel and determined
mouth&mdash;these were the features that
most impressed Karl as he stared wordlessly
at this Zar of the Eastern Hemisphere.
The magnificence of the royal
robe was lost on the young wearer of
the gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, so this is Peter Van
Dorn, my beloved nephew.&rdquo; The Zar
was speaking and the chilly sarcasm
in which the words were uttered belied
the friendliness they otherwise might
have implied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m told,&rdquo; replied Karl,
&ldquo;though I didn&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m supposed
to be the nephew of so great a figure
as yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not bad that, for an humble wearer
of the gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes, indeed. Why else
should I have sent for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have wondered why&mdash;and still
wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you wonder, eh?&rdquo; The Zar inspected
him carefully and then broke
into a cackle of horrible laughter. &ldquo;A
Van Dorn in gray denim!&rdquo; he chortled.
&ldquo;A mole of the Americas! And to
think that even the Zar has been unable
to find him in all these years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; bellowed Karl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not
have your ridicule. Come to the point
now and have it over with. Kill me
if you will, but tell me the story!&rdquo; He
had seen the slender tube in the Zar&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>An</span> expression of surprise, almost of
admiration, flickered in the beady
eyes of the Zar and was gone. He
spoke coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I shall explain. You,
Peter, are actually my nephew. Your
father, Derek Van Dorn, was my brother;
he a king of Belravia and I a poor
but experienced scientist. He scorned
me and he paid, for I learned of the
ancient race of the other side of the
Moon, the side we can not see from
the earth. I went to them and enlisted
their aid in warring upon my brother.
When we returned to carry on this
war I learned that I had a son. So, too,
did Derek. But my son was born in
obscurity and Derek&rsquo;s son&mdash;you, Peter&mdash;in
the lap of luxury. The war was
short and, to me, sweet. Belravia was
first to fall, and I had your father removed
from this life by the vibrating
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You monster!&rdquo; cried Karl. But the
slender rod menaced him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;A moment, my hot-headed nephew.
I vowed I&rsquo;d have your life, Peter, but
your father had a few friends and one
of these spirited you away. So temporarily
you escaped. But now I have
you where I can keep that vow. You,
too, shall die. By the vibration. But
first&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give you a taste of
the purple. Just so the going will be
harder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Karl kept his temper as best he could.
He thought, conscience-stricken, of old
Rudolph, that good friend of his father.
Then he thought of that youth he had
taken from the Square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son?&rdquo; he asked gently. &ldquo;Has
he the triangular brand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Zar was taken aback. &ldquo;He has,
yes. Why?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen him in the Americas.
He now lies wounded and in peril of
his life. What do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Karl was triumphant as the Zar
paled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie, Peter Van Dorn!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>But</span> the beady eyes saw that the
young man was truthful. Sudden
fury assailed the monarch of the East.
A bell pealed its mellow summons and
three Moon men entered the Presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Taru&mdash;the radiovision! Our
ambassador in the Americas!&rdquo; The
Zar was on his feet, his hard features
terrible in fear and anger. &ldquo;By God!&rdquo;
he vowed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay waste the Americas
if harm has come to my son. And
you&rdquo;&mdash;turning to Karl&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll reserve
for you an even more terrible fate than
the vibrating death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The radiovision was wheeled in and
in operation. A frightened face appeared
in its disc: the Zar&rsquo;s ambassador
across the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreau&mdash;my son!&rdquo; snapped the Zar.
&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Majesty! Have mercy!&rdquo; gasped
Moreau. &ldquo;Paul has eluded us. He was
skylarking&mdash;in the lower levels of New
York. But our secret agents are combing
the passages. We&rsquo;ll have him in
twenty-four hours. I promise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rage of the Zar was terrible to
see. Karl expected momentarily that
the white flame would lay him low, for
the anger of the mad ruler was directed
first at Moreau, then at himself. But a
quick, evil calm succeeded the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Peter,&rdquo; he stated, in tones suddenly
silky, &ldquo;shall have that twenty-four
hours&mdash;no more. If Moreau has
not produced my son in that time you
shall be dismembered slowly. A finger;
an ear; your tongue; a hand&mdash;until you
reveal the whereabouts of the heir to
my throne!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! You scum!&rdquo; Karl was on
the dais in a single bound. He had the
Zar by the throat, his fingers twisting
in the flabby flesh. Might as well have
it over at once. &ldquo;Fratricide&mdash;murderer
of my father, I&rsquo;ll take you with me!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>But</span> it was not to be. The throne
room was filled with retainers of
the mad emperor. Strong hands tore
him away and he was borne, struggling
and fighting, to the floor. A sharp pain
in his forearm. A deadening of the
muscles. He was powerless, save for
the painful ability to crawl to his
knees, swaying drunkenly. A delicious
languor overcame him. Nothing mattered
now. He saw that a tall man in
the purple had withdrawn the needle
of the hypodermic and was replacing
the instrument in its case. Ever so
slowly, it seemed.</p>
<p>The Zar was laughing. That horrible
cackle. But Karl didn&rsquo;t care.
They&rsquo;d have their sport with him. Let
&rsquo;em! Then it&rsquo;d be over. Lord! If
only he had been a little quicker. He&rsquo;d
have torn the old Zar&rsquo;s windpipe from
its place!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word,&rdquo; laughed the Zar. &ldquo;The
sacred word of a Van Dorn. I gave
it. He&rsquo;ll wear the purple for a day.
Take him from my sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Karl was walking, quite willingly
now. The effects of the drug were
altering. His muscular strength returned
but his mental state underwent
a complete change. Always he&rsquo;d wanted
a taste of the purple. For years he&rsquo;d
listened to the orators of the Square,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
to the conflicting statements of old
Krassin. But now he&rsquo;d see. He&rsquo;d know
the joys of the upper levels; the pleasure
cities, perhaps. For one day. But
what did it matter? He found himself
laughing and joking with his companion,
a heavy-set wearer of the purple.
They were in a luxurious apartment.
Servants! Moon men all of
them, but so efficient. They stripped
him of his gray denim; discarded it
contemptuously. Karl kicked the heap
into a corner and laughed delightedly.
His bath was waiting.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Much</span> can happen in a day.
Clothed in the purple, Karl&mdash;Peter
Van Dorn, he was, now&mdash;expanded.
Turgid emotions surged through
his new being. He was a new man. In
his rightful place. He was delighted
with the companionship of his new
friend of the purple, Leon Lemaire.
An euphonious name! A fine fellow!
Fool that the Zar must be, to leave
him in the care of so amiable a man.
Why, Leon couldn&rsquo;t hold him! None
of them could. He&rsquo;d escape them all&mdash;if
he wished. Twenty-four hours,
indeed!</p>
<p>They were in the midst of a gay
company. Wine flowed freely, and
Leon had attached to their party a pair
of beautiful damsels, young, and easy
to know. There was music and dancing.
Lights of marvelous color played
over the assemblage in the huge hall,
swaying their senses at the will of some
expert manipulator. Peter was a different
person now. He was exhilarated
to the point of intoxication, but not by
the wine. Somehow he couldn&rsquo;t bear
the taste of the amber fluid the others
were imbibing with such gusto. The
effects of the drug had left a coppery
taste in his mouth. But no matter!
Rhoda, his lovely companion at the table
leaned close. Her breath was hot
at his throat. He swept her into his
arms. Leon and the other girl laughed
approvingly.</p>
<p>There were many such places in the
upper levels of Dorn and they traveled
from one to another. Now their
party was larger, it having been augmented
by the appearance of other of
Leon&rsquo;s friends. Fine companions, these
men of the purple, and the women
were incomparable. Especially Rhoda.
They understood one another perfectly
now. It was all as he had pictured it.</p>
<p>Someone proposed that they visit the
intermediate levels. It would be such
a lark to watch the mechanicals. They
made the drop in a lift. A laughing,
riotous party. And Peter was one of
them! He felt that he had known them
for years. Rhoda clung to his arm, and
the languorous glances from under her
long lashes set the blood racing madly
in his veins.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>In</span> the levels of the mechanicals they
romped boisterously. To them the
strange robots&mdash;creatures of steel and
glass and copper&mdash;were objects of ridicule.
Poor, senseless mechanisms that
performed the tasks that made the
wearers of the purple independent of
labor. Here they saw the preparation
of their synthetic food, untouched by
human hands. In one chamber a group
of mechanicals, soulless and brainless,
engaged in the delicate chemical compounding
of raw materials that went
into the making of their clothing.
Here was a nursery, where tiny tots
born to the purple were reared to
adolescence by unfeeling but efficient
mechanical nurses. The mothers of
the purple could not be bothered with
their offspring until they had reached
the age of reason. The whirring machinery
of a huge power plant provided
much amusement for the feminine
members of the party. It was all so
massive; throbbing with energy. But
dirty! Ugh! Lucky the attendants
could be mechanicals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have visited the lower levels,&rdquo;
whispered Rhoda in his ear, &ldquo;but not
often. It isn&rsquo;t pleasant. Ignorant
fools in the gray denim&mdash;too many of
them. I don&rsquo;t know why we permit
their existence. Fools who will not
learn. Education made us as we are,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
and they won&rsquo;t take it. Sullen looks
and evil leers are all that they have
for us. Hope nobody suggests going
down there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; said Peter. He had forgotten
that once he was Karl Krassin,
a wearer of the despised gray.</p>
<p>Someone in the party was becoming
restless. They must move on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; asked Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sans Dolor, sweet boy. A pleasure
city within a hundred kilometers of
Dorn. You&rsquo;ll love it, Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pleasure city! Fondest dream of
the wearers of the gray! In the dim
past, when he was Karl, he had dreamed
it often. Now he was to visit one!</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>They</span> were atop the city now and
the crystal palace of the Zar shimmered
in the sunlight off there across
the flat upper surface of Dorn. But it
seemed so far away that Peter did not
give it a second thought. He was living
in the present.</p>
<p>A swift aero took them into the skies
and they roared out above the wilderness
that was everywhere between the
great cities of earth. Funny nobody
thought of leaving the cities and exploring
the jungles of the outside.
But, of course, it wasn&rsquo;t necessary.
They had everything they needed within
the cities. All of their wants were
supplied by the mechanicals and by the
few toilers in the gray who still persisted
in ignorance and in some perverse
ideas that they must work in
order to live. Besides, the jungle was
dangerous.</p>
<p>Sans Dolor loomed into view, a great
island floating in the air a thousand
meters above the tossing waters of the
ocean. Peter gave not a thought to the
forces that kept it suspended. Dimly
he recalled certain words of old Rudolph,
words regarding the artificial
emanations that had been discovered as
capable of counteracting the force of
gravity. But his mind was intent on
the pleasures to come.</p>
<p>They were over the city. Carefully
tended foliage lined its streets and a
smooth lagoon glistened in its center.
Its towers and spires were decorated
with gay colors. The streets were filled
with wearers of the purple and the
nude bodies of bathers in the lagoon
gleamed white in the strong sunlight.</p>
<p>He sensed anew the nearness of
Rhoda. Her soft warm hand nestled
in his and she responded instantly to
his sudden embrace.</p>
<p>There came a shock and the party
was stilled in dismay. The aero careened
violently and the pilot struggled
with controls that were dead.
Sans Dolor dropped rapidly away beneath
them. They were shooting skyward,
drawn by some inexplicable and
invisible energy from above.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Rhoda</span> screamed and held him
close, trembling violently. All of
the women screamed and the men
cursed. Leon arose to his feet and
stared at Peter. The friendliness was
gone from his features and he spat
forth an accusation. A glistening mechanism
appeared in his hand as if by
magic. A ray generator! He had been
appointed by the Zar to guard this upstart
and, whatever happened, he&rsquo;d not
let him escape with his life. The girl
shuddered at sight of the weapon and
extricated herself from his arms. Her
affection too had been a pose.</p>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s mind was clearing from the
effects of the drug. He had not the
slightest idea of what might have
caused the quick change in the situation
but he resolved he would die fighting,
if die he must. Leon fumbled
with the catch of the generator. It refused
to operate. The force that was
drawing them upward had paralyzed
all mechanisms aboard the little aero.
Flinging it from him in disgust he
sprang for Peter.</p>
<p>Their minds befuddled, the rest of
the men watched dully. The women
huddled together in a corner, whimpering.
They were a sorry lot after all,
thought Karl. He was no longer Peter
Van Dorn, and he thrilled to the joy of
battle.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Leon Lemaire</span> was no mean antagonist.
His flailing arms were
everywhere and a huge fist caught Karl
on the side of his head and sent him
reeling. But this only served to clear
his mind further and to fill him with a
cold rage. He bored in unmercifully
and Lemaire soon was on the defensive.
A blow to his midsection had him
puffing and Karl hammered in rights
and lefts to the now sinister face that
rocked his opponent to his heels. But
the minion of the Zar was crafty. He
slid to the floor as if groggy, then with
catlike agility, dove for Karl&rsquo;s knees,
bringing him down with a crash.</p>
<p>The air whistled by them as the ship
was drawn upward with ever-increasing
speed. The other passengers
cowered in fright as the two men rolled
over and over on the floor, banging at
each other indiscriminately. Both
were hurt. Karl&rsquo;s lip was split, and
bleeding profusely. One eye was closing.
But now he was on top and he
pummeled his opponent to a pulp.
Long after he ceased resisting them,
the blows continued until the features
of Leon Lemaire were unrecognizable.
The infuriated Karl did not see that
one of the members of the party was
creeping up on him from behind.
Neither was he aware that the upward
motion of the aero had ceased and that
they now hung motionless in space. A
terrific blow at the base of his skull
sent him sprawling. Must have been
struck by a rocket, one of those funny
ships that crossed the ocean so quickly.
A million lights danced before his aching
eyeballs.</p>
<p>Lying prone across the inert body
of his foe, dimly conscious and fingers
clutching weakly, he knew that the
cabin was filled with people. Alien
voices bellowed commands. There was
the screaming of women; the sound of
blows; curses ... then all was silence
and darkness.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>It</span> was a far cry to the little book
shop off Cooper Square, but Karl
was calling for Rudolph when he next
awoke to the realization that he was
still in the land of the living. His
head was bandaged and his tongue
furry. A terrible hangover. Then he
heard voices and they were discussing
Peter Van Dorn. He opened one eye
as an experiment. The other refused
to open. But it might have been worse.
At least he was alive; he could see well
enough with the one good optic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h!&rdquo; whispered one of the voices.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s recovering!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked solemnly into the eyes of
an old man; a pair of wise and gentle
eyes that reminded him somehow of
Rudolph&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet now, Peter,&rdquo; said the old man.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be all right in a few minutes.
Banged up a bit, you are, but nothing
serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me Peter,&rdquo; objected Karl.
He loathed the sound of the name;
loathed himself for his recent thoughts
and actions. &ldquo;I am Karl Krassin,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;and as such will remain
until I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were others in the room and
he saw glances of satisfaction pass between
them. This was a strange situation.
These men were not of the purple.
Neither were they of the gray.
Their garments shone with the whiteness
of pure silver. And that&rsquo;s what
they were; of finely woven metallic
cloth. Was he in another world?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Karl.&rdquo; The kind old
man was speaking once more. &ldquo;I
merely want you to know that you are
among friends&mdash;your father&rsquo;s friends.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Surprised</span> into complete wakefulness,
Karl struggled to a seated
position and surveyed the group that
faced him. They were a fine looking
lot, mostly older men, but there was a
refreshing wholesomeness about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father?&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not
alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my poor boy. Derek Van Dorn
left this life at the hands of your uncle,
Zar Boris. But we, his friends, are
here to avenge him and to restore to
you his throne.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;I still do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, because we&rsquo;ve kept
ourselves hidden from the world for
more than twenty-two years, waiting
for this very moment. There are forty-one
of us, including Rudolph, my
brother. We have lived in the jungle
since Boris conquered the Eastern
Hemisphere. But amongst our numbers
were several scientists, two greater
than was Boris, even in his heyday.
They have done wonderful things and
we are now prepared to take back what
was taken from Derek&mdash;and more. His
life we can not restore&mdash;Heaven rest
him&mdash;but his kingdom we can. And to
his son it shall be returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were given into Rudolph&rsquo;s care
when little more than a babe in arms
and he has cared for you well. We&rsquo;ve
watched, you know, in the detectoscopes&mdash;long
range radiovision mechanisms
that can penetrate solid walls,
the earth itself, to bring to us the images
and voices of persons who may be
on the other side of the world. We&rsquo;ve
followed your every move, my boy, and
the first time we feared for you was
yesterday when the drug of the Zar&rsquo;s
physician stole away your sense of
right and wrong. But we were in time
to save you, and now we are ready to
kneel at your feet and proclaim you
our king. First there is the Zar to be
dealt with and then we shall set up the
new regime. Are you with us?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Karl</span> gazed at the speaker in wonder.
He a king? Always to live
amongst the wearers of the purple? To
be responsible for the welfare of half
the world? It was unthinkable! But
Zar Boris, the murderer of his own
father&mdash;he must be punished, and at
the hands of the son!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;That
is, I&rsquo;ll do whatever you have planned
in the way of exterminating the Zar.
Then we&rsquo;ll talk of the new empire. But
how is the Zar to be overcome? I
thought he was invincible, with his
Moon men and terrible weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! That, my boy, is where our
scientists have triumphed. True, his
rays were terrible. They could not be
combatted when he first returned. The
strange chemicals and gases of the
Moon men defied analysis or duplication.
His citadel atop the city of Dorn
is proof against them all; proof against
explosives and rays of all kinds known
to him. The disintegration and decomposition
rays have no effect on the
crystal of its walls. It is hermetically
sealed from the outer air so can not be
gassed. The vibration impulses have
no effect upon its reinforced structure.
But there is a ray, a powerful destructive
agent, against which it is not
proof. And our scientists have developed
this agency. You shall have
the privilege of pressing the release of
the energy that destroys the arch-fiend
in his lair. His dominance over, the
empire will fall. We shall take it&mdash;for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange exaltation shone from the
faces of those in the room, and Karl
found that it was contagious. His
bosom swelled and he itched to handle
the controls of this wonderful ray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ray,&rdquo; continued the brother of
old Rudolph, &ldquo;carries the longest vibrations
ever measured, the vibrations of
infra-red, the heat-ray. We have succeeded
in concentrating a terrific
amount of power in its production, and
with it are able to produce temperatures
in excess of that of the interior
of the earth, where all substances are
molten or gaseous. The Zar&rsquo;s crystal
palace cannot withstand it for a second.
He cannot escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;ll you know he&rsquo;s there at the
time?&rdquo; Karl was greatly excited, but
he was curious too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me, my boy. I&rsquo;ll show
you.&rdquo; The old man led him from the
room and the others followed respectfully.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>They</span> stopped at a circular port
and Karl saw that they were
high above the earth in a vessel that
hovered motionless, quivering with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
what seemed like human eagerness to
be off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This vessel?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a huge sphere; the base of our
operations. To it we drew the aero on
which you were fighting. A magnetic
force discovered by our scientists and
differing only slightly from that used
in counteracting gravity. We let the
rest of them go; foolishly I think. But
it&rsquo;s done now and we have no fear.
From this larger vessel we shall send
forth smaller ones, armed with the
heat-ray. The flagship of the fleet is
to be yours and you&rsquo;ll lead the attack
on Dorn. Here&mdash;I&rsquo;ll show you the
Zar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the room of the
detectoscopes&mdash;a mass of mechanisms
that reminded Karl of nothing so much
as the vitals of the intermediate levels
which he had visited with Leon&mdash;and
Rhoda. He knew that he flushed when
he thought of her. What a fool he had
been!</p>
<p>A disc glowed as one of the silver-robed
strangers manipulated the controls.
The upper surface of Dorn
swung into view. Rapidly the image
drew nearer and they were looking at
the crystal pyramid that was the Zar&rsquo;s
palace. Down, down to its very tip
they passed. Karl recoiled from the
image as it seemed they were falling to
its glistening sides. The sensation
passed. They were through, penetrating
solid crystal, masonry, steel and
duralumin girders. Room after room
was opened to their view. It was magic&mdash;the
magic of the upper levels.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Now</span> they were in the throne room.
A group of purple-clad men and
women stood before the dais. Leon,
Rhoda&mdash;all of his wild companions
were there, facing the dais. The Zar
was raging and the words of his speech
came raucously to their ears through
the sound-producing mechanism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve failed miserably, all of you,&rdquo;
he screamed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gotten away and
you know the penalty. Taru&mdash;the
vibrating ray!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Moon man already was fussing
with a gleaming machine, a machine
with bristling appendages having metallic
spheres on their ends, a machine
in which dozens of vacuum tubes
glowed suddenly.</p>
<p>Rhoda screamed. It was a familiar
sound to Karl. He noted with satisfaction
that Leon could hardly stand
on his feet and that his face was covered
with plasters. Then, startled, he
saw that Leon was shivering as with
the ague. His outline on the screen
grew dim and indistinct as the rate of
vibration increased. Then the body
bloated and became misty. He could
see through it. The vibrating death!
His father had gone the same way!</p>
<p>Karl groaned at the thought. The
whine of the distant machine rose in
pitch until it passed the limit of audibility.
Tiny pin-points of incandescence
glowed here and there from the
Zar&rsquo;s victims as periods of vibration
were reached that coincided with the
natural periods of certain of the molecules
of their structure. They were no
longer recognizable as human beings.
Shimmering auras surrounded them.
Suddenly they were torches of cold
fire, weaving, oscillating with inconceivable
rapidity. Then they were
gone; vanished utterly.</p>
<p>The Zar laughed&mdash;that horrible
cackle again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; exclaimed Karl, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
go! The fiend must not live a moment
longer than necessary. Are you
ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rudolph&rsquo;s brother smiled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
ready Karl,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> great vessel hummed with activity.
The five torpedo-shaped
aeros of the battle fleet were ready to
take off from the cavities in the hull.
In the flagship Karl was stationed at
the control of the heat-ray. His instructions
in its operation had been
simple. A telescopic sight with crosshairs
for the centering of the object to
be attacked; a small lever. That was
all. He burned with impatience.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span></div>
<p>Then they were dropping; falling
clear of the mother ship. The pilot
pressed a button and the electronic motors
started. A burst of roaring energy
streamed from the tapered stern of
their vessel and the earth lurched violently
to meet them. Down, down they
dived until the rocking surface of
Dorn was just beneath them. Then they
flattened out and circled the vast upper
surface. From the corner of his eye
Karl saw that the other four vessels of
his fleet were just behind. There was
a flurry among the wasplike clouds of
pleasure craft over the city. They
scurried for cover. Something was
amiss!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; shouted Karl. &ldquo;The warning
is out! There is no time to lose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pressed his face to the eye-piece
of his sight, his finger on the release
lever of the ray. The crystal pyramid
crossed his view and was gone. Again
it crossed, more slowly this time. And
now his sight was dead on it, the
gleaming wall rushing toward him.
Pressure on the tiny button. They&rsquo;d
crash into the palace in another second!
But no, a brilliant flash obscured
his vision, a blinding light that made
the sun seem dark by comparison.
They roared on and upward. He took
his eye from the telescope and stared
ahead, down. The city was dropping
away, and, where the crystal palace had
stood, there was a spreading blob of
molten material from which searing
vapors were drifting. The roofs of the
city were sagging all around and great
streams of the sparkling, sputtering
liquid dripped into the openings that
suddenly appeared. Derek Van Dorn
was avenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Destroy! Destroy!&rdquo; yelled Karl
madly. A microphone hung before him
and his words rang through every vessel
of his convoy.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> lust of battle was upon him.
A fleet of the Zar&rsquo;s aeros had risen
from below; twenty of them at least.
These would be manned by Moon creatures,
he knew, and would carry all of
the dreadful weapons which had originated
on that strange body. But he did
not know that his own ships were insulated
against most of the rays used
by the Zar&rsquo;s forces. He knew only that
he must fight; fight and kill; exterminate
every last one of the Zar&rsquo;s adherents
or be exterminated in the attempt.</p>
<p>Kill! Kill! The madness was contagious.
His pilot was a marvel and
drove his ship straight for the massed
ships of the foe. The air was vivid
with light-streamers. A ray from an
enemy vessel struck the thick glass of
the port through which he looked and
the outer surface was shattered and
pock-marked. But a cloud of vapor
and a dripping stream of fiery liquid
told him his own ray had taken effect
on a vessel of the enemy. One! They
wheeled about and spiraled, coming up
under another of the Zar&rsquo;s aeros. It
vanished in a puff of steam and they
narrowly missed being covered by
the falling remnants of incandescent
liquid. Two! Karl&rsquo;s aim was good and
he gloated in the fact. Three! They
climbed and turned over, dropping
again into the fray. Four!</p>
<p>The air grew stifling, for the expended
energy of the enemies&rsquo; rays
must needs be absorbed. It could not
disintegrate them nor decompose their
bodies, but the contacts were many and
the liberation of heat enormous. They
were suffocating! But Karl would not
desist. They drove on, now beneath,
now above an enemy ship. He lost
count.</p>
<p>One of his own vessels was in trouble.
The report came to him from the
little speaker at his ear. He looked
around in alarm. A glowing object
reeled uncertainly over there between
two of the aeros of the Zar. The concentration
of beams of vibrations was
too much for the sturdy craft. It was
red hot and its occupants burned alive
where they sat. Suddenly it slipped
into a spin and went slithering down
into the city, leaving a gaping opening
where it fell. This sobered him somewhat,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
but he went into the battle with
renewed fury.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>How</span> many had they brought
down? Fifteen? Sixteen? He
tore his purple jacket from his body.
The perspiration rolled from his pores.
His own ship would be next. But what
did it matter? Kill! Kill! He shouted
once more into the microphone, then
dived into battle. Another and another!
In Heaven&rsquo;s name, how many
were there? It was maddening. If
only he could breathe. His lungs were
seared; his eyes smarting from the
heat. And then it was over.</p>
<p>Three of the Zar&rsquo;s aeros remained,
and these turned tail to run for it. No!
They were falling, nose down, under
full power; diving into the city from
which they had come. Suicide? Yes.
They couldn&rsquo;t face the recriminations
that must come to them. And anything
was better than facing that burning
death from the strange little fighters
which had come from out the skies.
Dorn was a mass of wreckage.</p>
<p>Karl tore at the fastenings of the
ports, searing his fingers on the heated
metal. His pilot had collapsed, the
little aero heading madly skyward with
no guiding hand. Air! They must
have air! He loosened the pilot&rsquo;s
jacket; slapped frantically at his wrists
in the effort to bring him to consciousness.
Then he was at the controls of
the vessel, tugging on first one, then
the other. The aero circled and spun,
executing the most dangerous of sideslips
and dives. A little voice was
speaking to him&mdash;the voice of the radio&mdash;instructing
him. In a daze he followed
instructions as best he could.
The whirlings of the earth stabilized
after a time and he found he was flying
the vessel; climbing rapidly.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>A sense</span> of power came to him as
the little voice of the radio continued
to instruct. Here were the controls
of the electronic motor; there the
gravity-energy. He was proceeding in
the wrong direction. But what did it
matter? He learned the meaning of the
tiny figures of the altimeter; the difference
between the points of the compass.
Still he drove on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;East! Turn East!&rdquo; begged the little
voice from the radio. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re heading
west. Your speed&mdash;a thousand
kilometers an hour&mdash;it&rsquo;s too fast. Turn
back, Zar Peter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tore the loud speaker of the radio
from its fastenings. West! He wanted
to go west! On and on he sped, becoming
more and more familiar with
the workings of the little vessel as he
progressed. A cooling breeze whistled
from the opened ports, a breeze that
smelled of the sea. His heart sang with
the wonder of it all. He could fly.
And fly he did. Zar Peter? Never!
He knew now where he belonged; knew
what he wanted. He&rsquo;d find the coast of
North America. Follow it until he located
New York. A landing would be
easy, for had not the voice instructed
him in the use of the gravity-energy?
He&rsquo;d make his way to the lower levels,
to the little book shop of Rudolph
Krassin. A suit of gray denim awaited
him there and he&rsquo;d never discard it.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Onward</span> he sped into the night,
which was falling fast. He held
to his westward course like a veteran
of the air lanes. The pilot had ceased
to breathe and Karl was sorry. Game
little devil, that pilot. Have to shove
his body overboard. Too bad.</p>
<p>Rudolph&rsquo;s brother would understand.
He&rsquo;d be watching in the detectoscope.
And the others&mdash;those who had wished
to seat him on a throne&mdash;they&rsquo;d understand,
too. They&rsquo;d have to!</p>
<p>Rudolph would forgive him, he
knew. Paul Van Dorn&mdash;his own cousin&mdash;the
secret agents of the Zar would
never locate him! Too many friends
of Rudolph&rsquo;s were of the red police.</p>
<p>He gave himself over to happy
thoughts as the little aero sped on in
the darkness. Home! He was going
home! Back to the gray denim, where
he belonged and where now he would
remain content.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Kirby</span> did not know what
mountains they were. He did
know that the Mannlicher
bullets of eleven bad Mexicans
were whining
over his head
and whizzing
past the hoofs of
his galloping,
stolen horse. The
shots were mingled with yelps which
pretty well curdled his spine. In the
circumstances, the unknown range of
snow mountains towering blue and
white beyond the arid, windy plateau,
offering he could not tell what dangers,
seemed a
paradise. Looking
at them, Kirby
laughed harshly
to himself.</p>
<p class='sidebarright'>A beautiful face in the depths of a
geyser&mdash;and Kirby plunges into a desperate
mid-Earth conflict with the dreadful
Feathered Serpent.</p>
<p>As he dug the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
heels of his aviator&rsquo;s boots into the
stallion&rsquo;s flanks, the animal galloped
even faster than before, and Kirby
took hope. Then more bullets and
more yelps made him think that his
advantage might prove only temporary.
Nevertheless, he laughed again, and as
he became accustomed to the feel of a
stallion under him, he even essayed a
few pistol shots back at the pack of
frantic, swarthy devils he had fooled.</p>

<p class='caption'>
<i>His head wavered back and forth and his hiss filled the night.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Three hours ago he had been eating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
a peaceful breakfast with his friend
and commandant, Colonel Miguel de
Castanar, in the sunlit patio of the
commandant&rsquo;s hacienda. Castanar,
chief of the air patrol for the district,
had waxed enthusiastic over the suppression
of last spring&rsquo;s revolutionists
and the cowed state of up-country bandits.
Captain Freddie Kirby, American
instructor of flying to Mexican
pilots in the making, had agreed with
him and asked for one of the Wasps
and three days&rsquo; leave with which to
go visiting in Laredo. The simple matter
of a broken fuel line, a forced landing
two hundred kilometres from nowhere,
and the unlucky proximity of
the not-so-cowed horsemen, were the
things which had changed the day
from what it had been to what it was.</p>
<p>The one piece of good fortune which
had befallen him since the bandits had
surrounded the wrecked Wasp, looted
it, and taken its lone pilot prisoner,
was the break he was getting now.
During the squadron&rsquo;s first halt to feed,
he had knocked down his guards and
made a bolt for the grazing stallion.
So far, the attempt was proving worth
while.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>On</span> and on the stallion lunged toward
the white mountains. Kirby&rsquo;s
eyes became red rimmed now from
fatigue and the glare of the sun and
the dust of the pitilessly bare plateau.
A negligible scalp wound under his
mop of straw-colored hair, slight as it
was, did not add to his comfort. But
still he would not give up, for the
horse, as if it sensed what its rider
needed most, was making directly for
a narrow ravine which debouched on
the plateau from the nearest mountain
flank.</p>
<p>It was the promise of cover afforded
by the jagged rocks and jungle growth
of that ravine which kept hope alive
in Kirby&rsquo;s throbbing brain.</p>
<p>The stallion was blown and staggering.
Foam from the heavily bitted
mouth flashed back in great yellow
flakes against Kirby&rsquo;s dust-caked aviator&rsquo;s
tunic. But just the same, the five
mile gallop had carried both horse and
rider beyond range of any but the most
expert rifle shot. And Kirby knew
that if his own splendid mount was almost
ready to crash, the horses of his
pursuers must be in worse shape still.
So for the third time since the fight
had begun, he laughed. This time there
was no harshness, but only relief, in
the sound which came from his dry
lips.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, he flung himself
out of his saddle. Like the caress of
a vast, soothing hand, the shadowed
coolness of the ravine lay upon him.
As his feet struck ground, they
splashed in the water overflowing from
a spring at the base of an immense
rock. At once Kirby dropped the reins
on the stallion&rsquo;s neck, giving him his
freedom, and as the horse lowered his
head to drink, Kirby stooped also.</p>
<p>There was cover everywhere. Kirby&rsquo;s
first move after pulling both himself
and the horse away from the spring,
was to glance up the long, deeply
shaded canyon which he had entered&mdash;a
gash hacked into the breast of the
steep mountain as by a titanic ax.
Then, reassured as to the possibilities
for a defensive retreat, he glanced back
toward the dazzling, bare plateau.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>It</span> was what he saw taking place
amongst the sombreroed bandits
out there which made the grin of satisfaction
fade from his broad mouth.
His last glance backward, before bolting
into the canyon mouth, had showed
him a ragged squadron of men left far
behind, yet galloping after him still.
But now&mdash;</p>
<p>Presently a puzzled frown made
wrinkles in Freddie Kirby&rsquo;s wide sunburned
forehead. He relaxed his grip
upon the heavy Luger, which, in his
big hands, looked like a cap pistol, and
rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>But he was not mistaken. The horsemen
had halted! Out there on the glaring,
alkali-arid plateau, they were
standing as still as so many statues.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
Looking toward the canyon mouth
which had swallowed their quarry,
they certainly were, but they were
halted as completely as men struck
dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; Kirby grunted, and scratched
behind his ear.</p>
<p>The next second he swung around
to look at his horse, uncertain what he
was going to do next, but aware of the
fact that right now, with a lot of unknown
country between himself and
Castanar&rsquo;s sunlit patio, the stallion was
going to be a friend in need.</p>
<p>As he turned, however, prepared to
take up the loose reins, something else
happened. The stallion let out a neigh
as shrill as a trumpet blast. As Kirby
jumped, grabbed for the bridle, his fingers
found empty air. Like a crazy
animal the stallion leaped past him,
barely missing him. Out toward the
plain the horse jumped, out and away
from the shaded canyon mouth, out
toward the spot where other horses
waited. And despite the animal&rsquo;s blown
condition, the speed he put into his
retreat left Kirby dazed.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>After</span> a helpless, profanity-filled
second, Kirby scratched behind
his ear again. As certain as the fact
that almost his sole hope of getting
back to civilization depended upon the
stallion, was the fact that the brute
did not intend to stop running until
he dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what in the hell ever got into
his crazy head?&rdquo; Kirby muttered
grimly.</p>
<p>Then he turned around to glance up
the shadow-filled slash of a canyon,
and sniffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faintly in the air had risen an odor
the like of which he had never encountered
in his life. A combination, it
was, of the unforgetable stench which
hangs over a battlefield when the dead
are long unburied, and of a fragrance
more rare, more heady, more poignantly
sweet than any essence ever concocted
by Parisian perfumer.</p>
<p>With the drifting scent came a
sound. Faint, carrying from a distance,
the rumble which Kirby heard
was almost certainly that of a geyser.</p>
<p>There was no telling what had
brought the troop of horsemen to a
halt, but after a time Kirby knew that
the cause of his horse&rsquo;s sudden departure
must have been a whiff of the
strange perfume.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>For</span> a long time he stood still,
watching the crazy stallion dwindle
in size, watching the line of unexpectedly
timid bandits. Then, when it
became apparent that the horsemen
were going to stay put either until he
came out, or showed that he never was
coming out, he shrugged, and swung
on his heel so that he faced up the
canyon.</p>
<p>The odor was dying away now, and
the geyser rumble was gone. In Kirby&rsquo;s
heart came a mingled feeling of
tense uneasiness and fascinated curiosity.
Momentarily he was almost glad
that his horse <i>had</i> bolted, and that his
pursuers <i>were</i> blocking any lane of retreat
except that offered by the canyon.
If things had been different, the queer
behavior of the Mexicans, the unaccountable
actions of his horse and the
equally strange growth of his own uneasiness
might have made him uncertain
whether he would go up the canyon
or not. Now it was the only thing
to do, and Kirby was glad because, fear
or no fear, he wanted to go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said out loud as he
started, &ldquo;just what the denizens of
First Street in Kansas would say to a
layout like this!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>At</span> the end of an hour he was still
wondering.</p>
<p>At midday the canyon was chill and
dank, lit only by a half light which at
times dwindled to a deep dusk as the
rock walls beetled together hundreds
of feet above his head. Always when
he stumbled through one of the darkest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
passages, he heard and half saw
immense gray bats flapping above him.
In the half-lit reaches, he hardly took
a step without seeing great rats with
gray coats, yellow teeth, and evil pink
eyes. But rats and bats combined were
not as bad as the snakes. They were
almost white, and nowhere had he seen
rattlers of such size. If his caution
relaxed for a second, they struck at
him with fangs as long and sharp as
needles.</p>
<p>The tortured, twisted cedars, the
paloverdi, occatilla, cholla, opunti,
through which he edged his laborious
way, all offered an almost animate,
armed hostility.</p>
<p>Altogether this journey was the least
sweet he had taken anywhere. Yet he
went on.</p>
<p>Why had eleven Mexican bandits refused
to advance even to within decent
rifle range of the canyon&rsquo;s mouth?
What was there about the putrid yet
gorgeous perfume that had made the
stallion go off his nut, so to speak?</p>
<p>After a time, Kirby veered away
from a fourteen-foot rattler which
flashed in a loathsome coil on his left
hand. Hungry, weakened by all he had
been through since breakfast time, he
plodded doggedly on.</p>
<p>But a moment later he stumbled past
a twisted cedar, and then stopped, forgetting
even the snakes.</p>
<p>At his feet lay the bleached skeleton
of a man.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Beside</span> the right hand, in a position
which indicated that only
the final relaxation of death had loosened
his grip upon a precious object,
lay a cylinder, carefully carved, of rich,
yellow gold.</p>
<p>Of the science of anthropology
Kirby knew enough to make him sure
that the dolicocephalic skull and characteristically
shaped pelvic and thigh
bones of the skeleton had belonged to
a white man.</p>
<p>As for the cylinder&mdash;But he was
not so sure what that was.</p>
<p>Regardless of the dry swish of a rattler&rsquo;s
body on the rocks behind him,
he lifted the object from the spot in
which it had lain for no man knew
how long. Of much the size and shape
of an old-time cylindrical wax phonograph
record, the softly gleaming
thing weighed, he judged, almost two
pounds.</p>
<p>Two pounds of soft, virgin gold of
a quality as fine as any he had seen
amongst all the treasures brought out
of Mexico, Yucatan, and Peru combined!</p>
<p>But the gold was not the only thing.
If Kirby was human enough to think
in terms of treasure, he was also
enough of an amateur anthropologist
to hold his breath over the carvings on
the yellow surface.</p>
<p>First he recognized the ancient symbols
of Sun and Moon. And then a
representation, semi-realistic, semi-conventionalized,
of Quetzalcoatl, the
Feathered Serpent, known in all the
annals of primitive Mexican religions.</p>
<p>Good enough.</p>
<p>But the mere symbols by no means
told the whole story of the cylinder.
The workmanship was archaic, older
than any Aztec art Kirby knew, older
than Toltec, older far, he ventured to
guess, than even earliest archaic Mayan
carvings.</p>
<p>God, what a find!</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>For</span> a moment it seemed almost
impossible that he, Freddie Kirby,
native of Kansas, unromantic aviator,
should have been the one to discover
this relic of an unknown, lost race.
Yet the cylinder of gold was there, in
his hand.</p>
<p>After a long minute Kirby looked
around him, then listened.</p>
<p>From up the canyon came the provocative
rumble of the geyser. It was
closer now, and Kirby, glancing at his
watch which had been spared to him
in the Wasp&rsquo;s crash, noted that just
forty-four minutes had passed since
the last eruption. There was nothing
to be done about the bleached skeleton.
So, tucking the precious cylinder into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
his tunic, Kirby headed on up the gash
of a canyon.</p>
<p>Far away indeed seemed the neat,
maple-shaded asphalt street, the rows
of parked cars and farm wagons, the
telephone office and drug store and
bank, of the Kansas town where he had
grown up.</p>
<p>Time passed until again he heard the
geyser, and again was dizzied by the
perfume. As the fragrance&mdash;close and
powerful now&mdash;died away, he flailed
with one arm at a two-foot bat which
flapped close to his head.</p>
<p>And then he trudged his dogged way
around a deeply shadowed bend, and
found the chasm not only almost
wholly dark, but narrower than it had
been at any previous point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy mackerel,&rdquo; Kirby groaned.
&ldquo;Phew! If this keeps up, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped. His jaw dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beetling walls narrowed in until
the gash was scarcely fifteen feet
wide. Further progress was barred by
a smooth wall which rose sheer in
front of him.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Kirby</span> did not know how many
seconds passed before he made
out through the gloom that the wall was
man-made and carved with the same
symbols of Sun, Moon, and Feathered
Serpent, which ornamented the cylinder
of gold. But when he did realize
at last, the shout with which he expressed
his feeling was anything but
a groan.</p>
<p>It simply meant that the skeleton
which once had been a man, had almost
surely found the golden cylinder beyond
the wall and not in the canyon.
And if the dead man had passed that
smooth, carved barrier, another man
could do it!</p>
<p>Kirby jumped forward, began to
search in the darkness for some hidden
entrance.</p>
<p>Minute after minute passed. He
gave another cry. He saw a long, upright
crack in the stone surface, and
a quick push of his hands made the
stones in front of him give almost an
inch.</p>
<p>All at once his shoulder was planted,
and behind that square shoulder
was straining all the muscle of his
two hundred pound body. The result
was all that he desired. When he
ceased pushing, a slab of rock gaped
wide before him, giving entrance to a
pitch dark tunnel.</p>
<p>For a moment he held the portal
back, then, releasing his pressure, he
stepped into the dark passage. By the
time a ponderous grating of rocks assured
him that the door had swung
shut of its own weight, he had produced
matches and struck a light.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> puny flame showed him a
curving passage hewn smoothly
through the heart of bedrock. Before
the flare died he walked twenty feet,
and as another match burned to his fingers,
he found the right hand curve
of the passage giving way to a left
hand twist. After that he dared use
no more of his precious matches. But
just when the darkness was beginning
to wear badly on his nerves, he uttered
a low cry.</p>
<p>As he increased his rapid walk to a
run, the faint light he had suddenly
seen ahead of him grew until it became
a circular flare of daylight which
marked the tunnel&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>Out of the passage Kirby strode with
shoulders square and head up, his cool,
level, practical blue eyes wide with
wonder. Out of the tunnel he strode
into the valley of the perfumed geyser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God above!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were vibrant with hoarse
reverence. He saw the sunlight of a
cliff-surrounded diminutive Garden of
Eden. He saw a vale of flowering
grass, of palms and live oaks, saw
patches of lilies so huge as to transcend
belief, and dizzying clumps of
tree cactus almost as tall as the palms
themselves.</p>
<p>What was more, he saw in the center
of this upland, cliff-guarded valley, a
gaping black orifice which every faculty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span>
of judgment told him was the
mouth of the geyser of perfume. And
beside it, outstretched on a smooth
sheet of rock which glistened as though
coated with a layer of clear, sparkling
glass, he saw&mdash;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Kirby</span> blinked his eyes rapidly,
hardly believing what he saw.</p>
<p>On the glistening rock lay the perfectly
preserved figure of a Spanish
Conquistadore in full armor. Morion
and breast-plate were in place, and
glistened as though they had been burnished
this morning. And the Spaniard&rsquo;s
dark, handsome, bearded face!
Kirby saw instantly that no decay had
touched it, that even the hairs of the
beard were perfect. The whole armor-clad
corpse gleamed softly with a covering
of the same glassy substance
which covered the rock.</p>
<p>Kirby glanced at his watch, saw that
twelve minutes must elapse before the
geyser spouted again. Then his eyes
narrowed. He remained standing where
he was, hard by the mouth of the tunnel,
knowing that a wise man would
conduct cautiously his exploration of
this valley of wonders.</p>
<p>Arsenic! Silicon!</p>
<p>The two words stood out sharply in
his thought. In Africa existed plenty
of springs whose waters contained
enough arsenic to bring death to those
who drank. Might not the Spaniard&rsquo;s
presence here be explained, then, by
assuming that the geyser water was
charged with a strong arsenic content,
and, in addition, with some sort of silicon
solution which, left to dry in the
air, hardened to glass?</p>
<p>Lord, what a discovery to take back
with him to Kansas! Almost it made
the discovery of the golden cylinder
pale by comparison. Why, the commercial
uses to which this silicon water
might be put were almost without
limit, and the owner of the concession
might confidently expect to make millions!</p>
<p>It was while Kirby stood there,
breathless and jubilant, waiting for
the geyser to spout, that he began to
feel that <i>he was being watched</i>.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with a start, he shot a
sweeping glance over the whole grove.
But that did no good. He saw nothing
save sunlight and waving green leaves.</p>
<p>Eleven days were to pass before he
discovered all that was to be involved
in that sensation of being gazed at by
unseen eyes.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>At</span> the beginning of the eleventh
morning in the valley, Kirby had
again posted himself close to the mouth
of the black tunnel, and again felt that
hidden eyes were observing him.</p>
<p>But this morning differed from the
first morning, because now, for the first
time, he was ready to do something
about the watcher or watchers. Exploration
of the whole valley had not
helped. Therefore, there lay at his feet
a considerable coil of rope, the manufacture
of which from plaited strands
of the tough grass in his Eden had
taken him whole days. With what patience
he could find, he was waiting for
the gigantic spout of milky-colored,
perfumed water which would mean that
the geyser had gone off and would
erupt no more for exactly forty-four
minutes.</p>
<p>Eleven days in the valley!</p>
<p>While he waited, Kirby considered
them. Who had made the beautiful
footprints beside him, when he had
slept at last after his arrival here?
Why had so many of the queer, fuzzy
topped shrubs with immense yam-shaped
roots, which grew here been
taken away during that first sleep, and
during all his other periods of sleep?
Who had taken them? Early in his
stay, he had learned that the tuberlike
roots were good to eat and would sustain
life, and he supposed that the unseen
people of the valley took them for
food. But who were these people of
the valley?</p>
<p>Who had laid beside him during his
first sleep the immense lily with perfume
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
like that which came with the
milky geyser spray&mdash;that spray of
death and delight mingled? Why had
someone scratched a line in the earth
from him directly to the distant orifice
of the geyser? Was this, as he
believed, a signal to come not only to
the edge of the orifice, <i>but to lower
himself down into its depths</i>? And if
the line were intended as a signal, did
the persons who came to the valley
while he slept, always eluding him,
wish him well or mean to do him harm?</p>
<p>Last question of all: had the beautiful
girl&rsquo;s face he believed he had seen
just once, been real or an hallucination?
It had been while he was kneeling
at the very edge of the geyser cone,
staring down its many colored throat,
that the vision had appeared. Misty
white amidst the green gloom, the face
had been turned up to him, smiling, its
lips forming a kiss, and its great eyes
beckoning. Had the face been real
or a dream?</p>
<p>Eleven days in the valley! Now,
with his braided rope ready at last, he
was going to do something which
might help to answer his questions.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Kirby</span> reached out and began to
run his grass rope, yard by yard,
through his hands, searching carefully
for any flaw. A canyon wren made the
air sweet above him, while the morning
sun began to wink and blink
against the shadows which still lay
against the face of the guardian cliffs.
Kirby glanced at his watch and got up.</p>
<p>Crossing beyond the mouth of the
geyser, he grinned good morning at
his friend the Conquistadore, and
marched on into the shade of the live
oak which grew nearest the geyser.
Here he made one end of his rope fast
to the gnarled trunk, inspected his pistol,
patted his tunic to make sure that
the cylinder of gold was safe, then
stood by to await the geyser.</p>
<p>With the passing of three minutes
there came from the still empty orifice
a sonorous rumbling. Kirby grinned.</p>
<p>From deep in the earth issued a
sound of fizzing and bubbling, and
then, to the accompaniment of subterranean
thunder, burst loose the milky,
upward column which had never ceased
to awe the man who watched so eagerly
this morning. As the titanic jet leaped
skyward now, the slanting rays of the
sun caught it, and turned the water,
fanning out, into a fire opal, into a
sheet of living color.</p>
<p>Kirby, hard headed to the last, drew
from the supply in one pocket of his
tunic, a strip of one of the tuberlike
roots, and munched it.</p>
<p>The thunder ceased. The waters receded.</p>
<p>After that Kirby hesitated not a second.
Promptly he moved forward,
flung his coil of line down into the
geyser tunnel, and swung on to the
line. By the time he had swallowed
the last bite of his breakfast, the world
he knew had been left behind, and he
was climbing down to a new.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>It</span> became at once apparent that the
gorgeously colored, glassy-smooth
throat glowed with tints which were
unfamiliar to him. He could perceive
these new shades of color, yet had no
name for them.</p>
<p>As he stopped after fifty feet to
breathe, the color phenomenon made
him wonder if the tuber roots he had
been eating had affected his vision;
then decided they had not. In addition
to food value, the roots had some
power to stimulate courage and a slight
mental exhilaration. But the drug had
proved non-habit forming, and Kirby
knew that his powers of perception
were not now, and never had been, affected.</p>
<p>He swung down further.</p>
<p>Just a moment after he began that
progress was when things began to
happen to him. First he heard what
seemed to be the low titter of a human
voice laughing sweetly. Next
came a far off, unutterably lovely
strumming of music. And then he
realized that, at a depth of about a
hundred feet, he was hanging level
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
with a hole which marked the mouth
of another tunnel.</p>
<p>This new tunnel sloped down into
the earth on his right hand. The floor
and walls were glassy smooth, and the
angle of descent was steep, but by no
means as steep as the drop of the vertical
geyser shaft in which he now
hung.</p>
<p>Laughter, music, the new tunnel suddenly
aroused an excitement which
made him quiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I saw <i>her</i>,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;she
was standing here, in the mouth of this
tunnel, looking up at me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violently, Freddie Kirby forgot the
maple-shaded street of his Kansas
town, forgot everything but desire to
reach the mouth of the new tunnel,
where the girl of the exquisite face
and beckoning lips had stood. Tightening
his grip on the rope, he began to
swing himself back and forth like a
pendulum.</p>
<p>It seemed probable that when the
geyser water shot up past the horizontal
tunnel, its force was so great
that no water at all entered. He redoubled
his efforts to widen his swing.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Then</span> his feet scraped on the floor,
and in a second he had alighted
there. He still hung stoutly to his line,
however, for the tunnel sloped down
sharply enough, and was slippery
enough, to prohibit the maintenance of
footing unaided.</p>
<p>The music which issued from the
depths of that stunningly mysterious
passage swelled to a crescendo&mdash;and
stopped. Kirby clung there to his
precarious perch, his feet slipping on
the glass under them with every move
he made, and feelings stirred in his
heart which had never been there before.</p>
<p>Then, as silence reigned where the
music had been, something prompted
him to look up. The next instant he
stifled a cry.</p>
<p>With widening eyes he saw the flash
of a white arm and the gleam of a
knife hovering over the spot where his
taut rope passed out of the geyser
opening into the sunshine of the outer
world. Again he stifled a cry. For
crying out would do no good. While
the suppressed sound was still on his
lips, the knife flickered.</p>
<p>Then Kirby was shooting downward,
the severed line whipping out after
him. The first plunge flung him off
his feet. A long swoop which he took
on his back dizzied him. But as the
fall continued, he was able to slow it a
little by bracing arms and legs against
the tunnel walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy Jeehosophat!&rdquo; he gurgled.</p>
<p>But there seemed to be no particular
danger. The slide was as smooth as
most of the chutes he had ever encountered
at summer swimming pools.
If ever the confounded spiral passage
came to an end, he might find that he
was still all right. As seconds passed
and he fell and fell, it seemed that he
was bound for the center of the earth.
It seemed that&mdash;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>He</span> swished around a multiple bend,
and eyes which had been accustomed
to darkness were blinded by
light.</p>
<p>It was light which radiated in all
colors&mdash;blue, yellow, browns, purples,
reds, pinks, and then all the new colors
for which he had no name. Somehow
Kirby knew that he had shot out of
the tunnel, which emerged high up in
the face of a cliff, and that he was dropping
through perfumed, brilliant air
resonant with the sound of birds and
insects and human cries. The funny
thing was that the pull of gravity was
not right, somehow, and he was dropping
fairly slowly. From far below,
a body of what looked like water was
sweeping up to meet him. Kirby
closed his eyes.</p>
<p>When he opened them again, his
whole body was stinging with the slap
of his impact, and he found that it was
water which he had struck. The proof
of it lay in the fact that he was swimming,
and was approaching a shore.</p>
<p>But such water! It was milky white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
and perfumed as the geyser flow had
been, and it seemed luminous as with
a radium fire. Had he not realized
presently that the fluid probably contained
enough arsenic to finish a thousand
like him, he would have thought
of himself as bathing in the waters of
Paradise.</p>
<p>But then he began to forget about
the poison which might already be at
work upon him.</p>
<p>Ahead of him, stretched out in the
gorgeous, colored light, ran a beach
which was backed by heavy jungle.
And on the beach stood the lovely
creatures, all clad in shimmering, glistening
garments, whose flutelike cries
had come to him as he fell.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Kirby</span> looked, and became almost
powerless to continue his swim.
The beauty of those frail women was
like the reputed beauty of bright
angels. That paralyzing effect of wonder,
however, did not last long.</p>
<p>The girls moved forward to the water&rsquo;s
edge, and, laughing amongst
themselves, beckoned to him with
lovely slender hands whose every motion
was a caress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be not afraid,&rdquo; called one in a curious
patois dialect, about five-sixths of
which seemed made up of Spanish
words, distorted but recognizable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water would kill you,&rdquo; called
another, &ldquo;as it killed the Spaniard in
armor. But we are here to save you.
I will give you a draught to drink
which will defeat the poison. Come on
to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby&rsquo;s heart was almost literally in
his mouth now, because the girl who
promised him salvation was she whose
lips had formed a kiss at him from the
green-gloomy throat of the geyser.</p>
<p>His feet struck a shale bottom. Panting,
he stood up and was conscious of
the fact that despite his forlornly dripping
and dishevelled condition, he was
tall and straight and big, and that for
some reason all of the girls on the
gleaming sand, and one girl in particular,
were anxious to receive him here.</p>
<p>The one girl had drawn a small,
gleaming flask of gold from the misty
bodice of her gown, and was holding
it out while she laughed with red lips
and great, dazzling dark eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pronto!</i>&rdquo; she called in pure Spanish,
and other girls echoed the word. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
went on the bright owner of the flask,
&ldquo;we thought you would <i>never</i> have
done with your work on the rope. It
took you so long!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Kirby</span> left the smooth lake behind
him and stood dripping on the
sand. The moment the air touched his
clothes, he felt that they were stiffening
slightly. Yet the sensation brought
no terror. He could not feel terror as
he faced the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him the flask, Naida!&rdquo; someone
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but the Gods <i>have</i> been kind to
us!&rdquo; echoed another.</p>
<p>The girl with the flask made a gesture
for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it Naida you are called?&rdquo; Kirby
put in quickly, and as he spoke the
Spanish words, the roll of them on his
tongue did much to make him know
that he was sane and awake, and not
dreaming, that this was still the
Twentieth Century, and that he was
Freddie Kirby.</p>
<p>Answering his question, Naida nodded,
and gave him the flask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A single draught will act as antidote
to the poison,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I drink,&rdquo; said Kirby as he raised the
flask, &ldquo;to the many of you who have
been so gracious as to save me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flashing smile, a blush was his answer.
And then he had wetted his lips
with, and was swallowing, a limpid
liquid which tasted of some drug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; Naida ordered in a
second.</p>
<p>As she reached for the flask, her
companions closed in as though a ceremony
of some sort had been completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it time to tell him yet, Naida?&rdquo;
piped one of the girls, younger than
the rest, whom someone had called
Elana.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>do</i> begin, Naida,&rdquo; chorused two
more. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wait <i>much</i> longer to
find out if he is going to help us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby turned to Naida, while a
soothing sensation crept through him
from the draught he had taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray tell me what it is that I am to
be permitted to do for you. I can
promise you that the whole of my life
and strength, and such intelligence as
I possess, is yours to command.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Excited</span> small cries and a clapping
of hands answered him. As
for Naida, her face lighted with glowing
joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, one who could say that, <i>must</i>
be the friend and protector of whom
we have stood in such bitter need!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; asked Kirby, &ldquo;is this need
which made one of you cut my rope,
so that I should come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A momentary silence was broken
only by the hum of insects in the perfumed
air, and by the golden thrilling
of a bird back in the jungle. Then
Kirby beheld Naida bowing to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; she said in a voice low
and flutelike. &ldquo;I will speak now since
you request it. Already you have seen
that you are here in our world because
we conspired amongst ourselves to
bring you here. Our reason&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, looked deep into his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amigo,&rdquo; she continued slowly, &ldquo;we
whom you see here are the People of
the Temple. For more centuries than
even our sages can tell, our progenitors
have dwelt here, where you find us,
knowing always of your outer world,
but remaining always unknown by it.
But now the time has come when those
of us who are left amongst our race
need the help of one from the outer
races we have shunned. Dangers of
various orders confront us who have
waited here for your coming. When we
first discovered you in the Valley of
the Geyser, the idea came to me that
we must make you understand our
troubles, and ask of you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But then she stopped.</p>
<p>As Kirby stared at her, the gentleness
of her expression was replaced by
a swift strength which made her majestic.</p>
<p>The next moment bedlam reigned
upon the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>They are after us!</i>&rdquo; gasped one of
the girls in terror. &ldquo;Quick, Naida!
Quick! Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Whatever</span> it was that threatened,
Naida did not need to be
told that the need for action was
pressing. She shouted at her companions
some order which Kirby did
not understand. From a pouch at her
side, she snatched out a greyish, spherical
vegetable substance which looked
almost like a tennis ball. Then she
braced herself as if to withstand an assault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand back!&rdquo; she cried to Kirby.</p>
<p>He had long ago ceased to wonder
at anything that might happen here.
Disappointed that Naida&rsquo;s story had
been interrupted, wondering what was
wrong, he obeyed Naida&rsquo;s order to keep
clear.</p>
<p>As he fell back and stood motionless,
there came from behind a dense screen
of shrubs which would have resembled
aloe and prickly pear bushes, save that
they were as big as oak trees, a ghastly
howling. The next second, hopped and
hurtled across the beach toward the
girls, a group of hair-covered, shaggy
creatures which were neither apes nor
men. The faces, contorted with lust,
were hideously leathery and brown, the
foreheads small and beetling, and the
mouths enormous, with immense yellow
teeth.</p>
<p>Helpless, Kirby realized that Naida
and all the others had clapped over
their faces curious masks which seemed
to be made of some crystalline substance,
and that now others had armed
themselves with the tennis balls. And
that was the last observation he made
before the battle opened furiously.</p>
<p>With a cry muffled behind her mask,
Naida leaped out in front of her
squadron and cut loose her queer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
vegetable ball with whizzing aim and
force.</p>
<p>Full into the snarling face of one of
the ape-men the thing smashed, filling
the air all about the creature with a
yellow, mistlike powder. Kirby was
half deafened by the yells of rage and
terror which went up from the entire
attacking band. The creature who had
been hit fell to his knees the while he
made agonized tearing movements at
his face and uttered shrill, jabbering
yelps.</p>
<p>Other balls flashed instantly from
Naida&rsquo;s ranks, and each brought about
the same ghastly result as the first. But
then Kirby saw that the whole jungle
seethed with the hairy, awful men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep back!&rdquo; Naida shrieked at him
through her mask. &ldquo;We have no mask
for you. If the powder from our fungi
touches you, it will be the end!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>With</span> gaps in the advancing line
filled as soon as each screeching
ape went down, the attackers leaped on
until Kirby knew they would be upon
the girls in a matter of seconds. A
sweat broke out on his neck.</p>
<p>But then an idea gripped him, and
suddenly, without even a last glance at
Naida, he leaped away even as she had
commanded.</p>
<p>A great boulder lay on the shore fifty
yards away. Toward it Kirby streaked
as though he had become coward. But
he had not turned coward.</p>
<p>By the time he reached the shelter
which would protect him from the
fungus mist, a turning point had come
in the battle. The ape-men had closed
in on the girls, were swarming about
them, and the mist balls had almost
ceased to fly. But the thing which
gave Kirby hope was that the apes
were not attempting to harm the girls.
They seemed victors, but they were not
committing atrocities.</p>
<p>It was the sharp intuition that something
like this might happen which had
sent Kirby fleeing from the fight. He
believed he might yet prove useful.</p>
<p>The thickest group of attackers were
jostling about Naida. As the screams
and sobs of the girls quivered out,
mingled with the guttural roaring of
the men, Naida was shut off by a solid
wall of aggressors.</p>
<p>Then Kirby saw her again. But now
two of the most powerful of the ape-men
had caught her up and was carrying
her. Her kicking and writhing and
biting accomplished nothing. The apes
were headed directly back to the
jungle.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Now</span>, however, most of the yellow
mist had disappeared, and that
was all Kirby had been waiting for.
With a growling shout, he tore out
from behind his boulder, his Luger
ready. Naida&rsquo;s captors were in full retreat,
and other pairs of men were
snatching up other girls and hopping
after them. Toward Naida Kirby ran
madly but not blindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naida! Naida!&rdquo; he bellowed.</p>
<p>He got in two strides for every one
the apes made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naida!&rdquo; he shouted, and at last saw
her look at him.</p>
<p>Her face was pallid with loathing and
terror. As her glimmering dark eyes
met his, they flashed a plea which made
his heart thrash against his lungs.</p>
<p>With a final roar of encouragement
Kirby closed in on the hair-covered
men, and fired instantly a shot which
caught one full in the heart. The
creature wavered on its legs, looked at
the unexpected enemy with dismayed,
swinish little red eyes, and relaxing his
hold upon Naida, dropped without making
a sound.</p>
<p>After that&mdash;</p>
<p>But suddenly Kirby found himself
unable to comprehend fully the other
terrific results of his intervention. Before
the echoes of his shot died, there
came to him the rumble of what seemed
to be tons of falling rock. In the bright
air a slight mist was precipitated. To
all of which was added the effect upon
the ape-men of fear of a weapon and a
type of fighter utterly new to them.</p>
<p>Kirby had fired believing that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
would have to fight other ape-men when
the first fell. But not so. Instead of
that&mdash;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>He</span> blinked rapidly as he took in
the scene.</p>
<p>Naida had been released. Lying
on the sand beside the dead ape-man,
she was looking up at him in stupefied
wonder. And her other captor, instead
of remaining to fight, had clapped
shaggy hands over his ears, and was
leaping headlong for the protection of
the jungle!</p>
<p>Moreover, the soprano cries of the
girls and the deep howls of the men
were rising everywhere, and everywhere
the ape-men were dropping their
captives and plunging away after their
leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; Kirby muttered aloud, and
wondered what the citizens of Kansas
would have to say about <i>this</i>.</p>
<p>Naida looked at the dead and bleeding
ape-man and shuddered, and then
at the score or so of others brought
down by the puff balls. Then she
looked up at Kirby, raised her arms for
his support, and smiled up into his
brown face.</p>
<p>Kirby forgot Kansas, lifted her,
warm and alive, radiantly beautiful, in
his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our friends the enemies,&rdquo; she whispered
as she remained for a second in
his embrace and then drew away, &ldquo;will
attack no more this day&mdash;thanks to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no possible need for another
shot, Kirby saw. In terrified
silence, the first of the apes had already
floundered behind the prickly pear and
aloe bushes, and the last stragglers
were using all the power in their legs
to catch up. On the beach, Naida&rsquo;s
followers were picking themselves up,
and already a few of them had burst
into ringing laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, all of you,&rdquo; Naida said to
them, and, including Kirby in her
glance, added, &ldquo;We may as well go to
the caciques now, and have it over
with.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>It</span> was with Naida at his side and
the other girls grouped about them,
that they started their journey to the
&ldquo;caciques,&rdquo; whoever they might be, &ldquo;to
have it over with,&rdquo; whatever that might
mean. As they strode along in silence,
Kirby did what he could to straighten
out in his mind the many curious things
which had happened since he sat testing
his rope in the upper world this
morning.</p>
<p>In final analysis, it seemed to him
that, extraordinary as his experience
had been, there was nothing so much
out of the way about it, after all. The
only unusual thing was the existence
of this inhabited pocket in the earth.
For the rest, the strange colors to
which he could not put a name, were
simply some manifestation of infra-reds
and ultra-violets. And then the
startling effect of his single shot at
the ape-men&mdash;that was simply the old
story of savage creatures running from
a new weapon and a new enemy; naturally
the shot had sounded loud in this
enclosed cavern. Lastly, the pull of
gravity down here seemed upset somehow.
But why should it not seem so,
at this distance within the earth? The
American was no scientist; the conclusions
he reached seemed very reasonable
to him.</p>
<p>All told, the last thing Kirby found
he needed to do was pinch himself to
see if he was awake.</p>
<p>A place of indefinite extent, the
cavern seemed to be exactly what he
had already judged it&mdash;a giant pocket
within the earth. The ceiling, or the
sky, was of some kind of natural glass&mdash;no
doubt the same kind which was
crackling on his clothes now&mdash;and
from it emanated the brilliant, many
colored glow which lighted the cavern.
Radium? Perhaps it was that. Perhaps
the rays were cast off from some
other element even less understood
than mysterious radium. As for the
plant and animal life with which the
cavern teemed, it was amazing.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>But</span> Kirby did not give himself up
to silent observation any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you finish telling me,&rdquo; he asked
of Naida, &ldquo;about the task I am to perform
for you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naida, walking with lithe strides
along a path jungle-hemmed on both
sides, smiled at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to be our leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now both Naida and the other girls
became sober.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will lead us in a revolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Kirby whistled softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a revolt against the caciques&mdash;the
wise men&mdash;whose kind have governed
the People of the Temple since
the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her statement was received with acclaim
by the whole troop, who crowded
close around, the while they smiled at
Kirby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean I am to lead a revolt,&rdquo; he
asked, &ldquo;against these same caciques
whom we are going now to face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naida nodded emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if revolt proves necessary. And
it probably will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum.&rdquo; Kirby scratched behind his
ear. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better tell me what you
can about it.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Then</span>, as they hurried on, Naida
spoke rapidly.</p>
<p>The situation before the People of
the Temple was that for a long time
now, the only children to be born had
been girls. Worse still, not even a girl
had been born during a period equal to
sixteen upper-world years. The only
remaining members of a race which had
flourished in this underground land for
countless thousands of years, consisted
of the caciques, a handful of aged people,
and the thirty-four girls, including
Naida, who accompanied Kirby now.</p>
<p>On one hand was promised extinction
through lack of reproduction. On
the other, even swifter and more terrible
extinction at the hands of the
ape-men, whom Naida called the Worshippers
of Xlotli, the Rabbit God, the
God of all bestiality and drunkenness.</p>
<p>It was the menace of the ape-men,
rather than the less appalling one of
lack of reproduction, which was making
the most trouble now. Ages ago,
when the People of the Temple had
flourished as a race, they had been untroubled
by the Worshippers of Xlotli.
But now the ape-men were by far the
stronger; and they desired the girls
who had been born as the last generation
of an ancient race. The battle of
this morning had been only one of
many.</p>
<p>Dissension between the caciques, who
ruled the People of the Temple, and
their girl subjects, had arisen on the
subject of the best way of dealing with
the ape-man menace.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Some</span> time ago, Naida, heading a
council of all the girls, had proposed
to the caciques that support be
sought amongst the people of the upper
world. This would be done judiciously,
by bringing to the lower realm
a few men who were wise and strong,
men who would make good husbands,
and who could fight the ape-men.</p>
<p>This proposal the priests had
promptly quashed. They would never
receive, they said, any members of the
teeming outer races from whom the
People of the Temple had so long been
hidden. Those few who had blundered
into the Valley of the Geyser during
the centuries, and who had never escaped,
were enough. Better, said the
caciques, that a compromise be arranged
with the subjects of the Rabbit
God.</p>
<p>Flatly then, the priests had proposed
that some of the girls, the number to
be specified later, should be given to
the ape-men, and peace won. During
the time of reprieve which would thus
be afforded, prayers and sacrifices
could be offered the Lords of the Sun
and Moon, and to Quetzalcoatl, the
Feathered Serpent. In answer to these
prayers, the Gods would surely send
the aged people who alone were left as
prospective parents, a generation of
sons.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span></div>
<p>Once the priests&rsquo; program of giving
up some of the girls to the ape-men had
been made definite, it had not taken
Naida and the others long to decide
that they would never submit. And
then, while matters were at an acute
stage, a tall, blond white man had come
to the Valley of the Geyser&mdash;Kirby.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>As</span> Naida had finished her story,
Kirby mustered a smile despite
the soberness which had come upon
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the white man came,&rdquo; he repeated
after her, &ldquo;and all of you decided
forthwith to stage your revolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Naida answered. &ldquo;We
observed you until we were sure you
possessed the qualities of leadership we
wanted. After that, we did what we
could to coax you to come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby grinned at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Naida ended simply, &ldquo;we will
go to the caciques. If they accept you,
and grant our requests to them, there
will be peace. If they rage, it will be
war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly she drew closer to Kirby as
they swung along, and slipped her hand
into his, looking up at him in silent entreaty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much farther,&rdquo; he asked in
a voice which became sharp, &ldquo;until
we reach the headquarters of these
caciques?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They live in a castle which our
ancestors built ages ago on a protected
plateau,&rdquo; Naida answered tensely. &ldquo;It
is a good distance still, but we will
cover it soon enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They crossed now one edge of a
shadow-filled forest composed principally
of immense, pallid palmlike trees.
Farther on, the path wound through a
belt of swampy land covered by gigantic
reeds which rustled above their
heads with a glassy sound, and by
things which looked like the cat-tails
of the upper world, but were a hundred
times larger. Everywhere hovered
odd little creatures like birds, but with
teeth in their long snouts and small
frondlike growths on each side of their
tails. About some swamp plants with
very large blooms resembling passion
flowers, flitted dragon flies of jeweled
hues and enormous size, and under the
flowers hopped strange toadlike creatures
equipped with two pair of gauzy
wings.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Finally</span>, through a tunnel composed
of ferns a hundred feet
high, they emerged to a still densely
overgrown but higher country which
Naida said was a part of the Rorroh
forest.</p>
<p>In the forest, Kirby gained a hazy
impression of bronzy, immense cycads
and what appeared to be tree chrysophilums
with gorgeous blossoms.
Then he received a much clearer impression
of other trees with blossoms
of bright orange yellow and very thick
petals, each tipped with a glassy sharp
point. The disconcerting thing about
the tree was that, as they approached,
the scaly limbs began to tremble and
wave, and suddenly lashed out as
though making a human effort to snatch
at the bright travelers.</p>
<p>Naida and all the others hurried
along without offering comment, and
Kirby asked no questions.</p>
<p>Once he thought he saw a group of
gorilla creatures parallelling their
course back amongst the forest growth,
but if Naida observed the animals, she
paid no attention. The one thing which
had any effect upon the company was
the appearance, presently, of two vast,
birdlike creatures. As these things approached,
Naida signaled to all to
crouch beneath the shelter of a tall
rock beside the path.</p>
<p>Enormous, the birds had bat wings,
and carried with them, as they approached,
the stink of putrid flesh. The
long beaks were overfull of sharp teeth.
The heads, set upon bodies of glistening
white-grey, were black. Reddish
grey eyes searched the jungle as the
creatures flapped along. But, the
Pterodactyls&mdash;if they were that&mdash;passed
above Naida&rsquo;s band without offering
attack, and presently Naida
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span>
gave the command to advance again.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>In</span> time, they came to a chasmlike
gorge across which was suspended
a slender long thread of a bridge. Not
far above the bridge, a considerable
river emptied itself into the gorge in
a mirrorlike ribbon. Kirby could not
hear the torrent fall&mdash;or rather could
not hear it strike any solid bottom.
But from somewhere in the unlighted,
unfathomed depths of the abyss rose
strange bubbling and whistling sounds.</p>
<p>At the bridge, Naida paused and
pointed to the land across the river.
And as Kirby looked in the direction
indicated, he beheld a rocky eminence
rising for several hundred feet straight
up from the expanse of a level, tree and
grass covered plain. Atop of the
plateau, glimmered the complex towers
and turrets, the crenellated walls of a
castle which, in its grey antiquity,
seemed as old as the race of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is behind those walls that the
caciques dwell,&rdquo; Naida said quickly.
&ldquo;It is behind the castle, in a series of
separate houses, that the older members
of the race dwell. We shall go
and look upon them presently. But
first we will force an interview with
the caciques.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In silence Kirby took her hand, and,
with the others following, they moved
out upon the swaying, perilous causeway
which hung above the chasm.
After that, the trip across the plain to
the foot of the plateau cliffs was
quickly accomplished.</p>
<p>Here, however, Kirby thought they
must face trouble, for he found that the
great walls, of a sparkling, almost
glassy smoothness, shot up to a height
of at least three hundred feet, and that
no path of any sort was visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but how can
we get up?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>But</span> understanding began to dawn
as Naida laughed, and produced
from the pouch at the side of her gauzy
dress four pliable discs of a substance
which resembled rubber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very strong, are you not?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will have no trouble in
following us up the cliff. Our Serpent
God, Quetzalcoatl, taught us how to
climb long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she handed Kirby the set
of vacuum discs, and producing another
for herself, moistened them in a
pool of water close at hand. Then, as
all of the girls followed her action, she
strapped them to her hands and feet,
and in a moment they had begun the
ascent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Kirby said presently, &ldquo;with
these things you could hang by your
feet and walk on a smooth ceiling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naida laughed, and they worked
their way upward.</p>
<p>When the climb was accomplished
and the discs were put away, Kirby
found himself standing on the outer
edge of a mediaeval paradise, of a
magnificent plateau partly fortified by
nature, partly by the hand of man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried in deep admiration,
then followed Naida.</p>
<p>The building&mdash;the castle&mdash;in the near
distance, resembled a castle of Spain,
save that there was greater beauty and
subtlety of architecture. Turreted on
all four corners, constructed of material
which looked like blocks of
natural glass, the fairylike structure
was crowned by a gigantic tower of
something which resembled obsidian.
Up and up this tower soared until its
gleaming black tip seemed almost to
touch the glassy-radiant sky of the
cavern.</p>
<p>No people showed themselves, and
Kirby saw that the bronze-studded
portals set in the front of the castle
were closed.</p>
<p>Admiringly, he glanced at the surrounding
land laid out in checkerboard
patches of gardens and orchards where
grew a bewildering variety of unknown
fruits and blooms. Butterflies drifted
past, and the air was freighted with
the scent of flowers. Inside a walled
enclosure, Kirby saw a good-sized plot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span>
heavily grown with the plant on which
he had been subsisting. As they passed
this ground, each of the girls, Naida
leading, made a strange little bowing,
gliding genuflection, and Kirby wondered.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Now</span>, however, new sights distracted
him as they crossed a
port drawbridge above a deep moat
which was a fairyland of aquatic
plants. Although not a sound had
come from the castle, the great entrance
doors were swinging back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be ready,&rdquo; Naida whispered, &ldquo;for
almost anything. The doors are being
opened by some of the palace guard. I
have little doubt that word was long
ago rushed to the caciques that we are
come to them with an upper-world
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby answered with a nod. Then
they passed the outer doors, passed inside,
and Kirby blinked at what he
saw.</p>
<p>In a long hall decorated bewilderingly
with a carven frieze in which appeared
all of the symbols common to
early Mexican religions, and many new
ones, stood a row of bright suits of
armor of the Sixteenth Century. From
each suit peered the glassy face and
shovel beard of a dead Conquistadore.</p>
<p>So this was what happened to intruders
from the upper world! The
Conquistadore who kept his long watch
beside the geyser was not the only one!
Kirby felt an involuntary chill prickle
up his back. But he was not given long
to think before Naida, ignoring the
gruesome array, clasped his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Behold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Kirby saw that with almost
magical silence the whole wall at the
end of the corridor was sliding back
to reveal an enormous amphitheatre in
the center of which stood a vast circular
table. Ranged in a semicircle about
that table, stood fifteen incredibly
ancient men clad in long, glistening
grey robes. Blanched beards trailed
down the front of the garments until
they all but touched the floor.</p>
<p>The caciques!</p>
<p>Kirby, on the threshold of the amphitheatre,
squared his shoulders and held
his head high. Then with Naida on his
right, his own eyes boring unyieldingly
into the smouldering, narrowed
eyes which stared at him, he advanced.</p>
<p>But in front of him the priests
moved suddenly. From Naida burst a
shriek. In the radiant glare of the
council room flashed the long, thin,
cruel blade of a sacrificial knife.</p>
<p>The cacique who had whipped it
from his robe flew at Kirby with a
condor swoop, talon-hands outstretched,
his wrinkled, bearded face contorted
with fury.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Before</span> Kirby was more than half
set to fight, the priest was clawing
at his throat, and a gnarled old fist
was poised to drive the knife in a death
stroke.</p>
<p>Kirby did the only thing he could do
quickly&mdash;sprang to one side. The move
saved him. The knife whipped past his
shoulder, and the cacique nearly fell.
But it had been a close enough squeak
for all that.</p>
<p>Nor was it over. After Kirby the
priest sprang with unexpected agility,
and before Kirby could snatch at his
pistol the talon-hands were lunging at
his throat once more.</p>
<p>With the gasps of the girls ringing
in his ears, Kirby bunched himself for
another side leap only to find the
cacique all over him like an octopus.
Momentarily the knife hung above his
chest, and Kirby, dismayed at the
powers of his opponent, almost felt that
the thing must plunge before he could
break the octopus hold.</p>
<p>But he had no intention of being defeated,
and now he was getting used to
the fight. The priest&rsquo;s left arm swiftly
clenched about his neck and shoulders,
and the right arm, with the knife, attempted
a drive through to the heart.
Suddenly, however, Kirby lurched
sideways and backward, and as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
octopus grip slackened for a flash, he
himself got a wrestler&rsquo;s grip that left
him ready to do business. As the priest
broke free, he slid around in an attempt
to fasten himself on Kirby&rsquo;s
back. Quickly, tensely Kirby doubled,
and knew that he had done enough.
The cacique shot over his shoulders,
described a somersault in midair, and
landed with a sharp crack of head and
shoulders against unyielding stone.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>From</span> the semicircle of other
priests went up a gasp. From
Naida came a strangled cry of joy.
Kirby made one leap for the knife
which had fallen from the cacique&rsquo;s
hand as he slumped into unconsciousness,
and then he straightened up
with the weapon safe in his possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, you old billygoat,&rdquo; he
croaked in English, &ldquo;maybe you won&rsquo;t
try any more fast ones for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A second later he stepped over the
sprawled body to stand beside Naida.</p>
<p>Upon the wrinkled countenances of
the remaining caciques was stamped a
look of dismay and hatred which
boded no good. It was plain to Kirby
that in battering up the man detailed
to kill him, he had committed a
desecration of first order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anyone else who cares to
fight?&rdquo; he flung at them in Spanish,
showing a contempt as great as their
rage.</p>
<p>The response he got was instant.
From one old gullet, then from others,
came choking, snarling sounds which
presently became words. By those
words Kirby heard himself cursed with
a vituperation which made him, even in
his temporary triumph, feel grave.</p>
<p>But he did not let that soberness
trouble him long. For the main point
now was that no one made a move to
fight further, which was what he had
expected. He had flung them the challenge,
knowing that he was possessed
of their knife, and suspecting that it
was their only weapon. The belief that
no one would care to try a barehanded
conflict, no matter what insult was
waiting to be avenged, seemed justified
as none of the caciques advanced, and
as even the cursing presently ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Kirby asked. &ldquo;There is to be
no more fighting?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>One</span> of the caciques now came forward
a few steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered with a lameness
which was not to be denied. &ldquo;But you,
a criminal interloper in our realm, have
been marked as a victim for sacrifice,
and from this there is no power in the
universe which can save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby, after a reassuring glance at
Naida, looked at the floored priest who
was sitting up now, looking stupidly
about, and feeling himself all over, and
Kirby suppressed a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I am to be sacrificed, eh? But
what happens until that time comes?
Listen my Wise Ones&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stabbed a finger at them, and his
eyes flashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! What you mean to say is
that I have defeated you, and you must
lay off me until you can launch another
attack. But I have a few things to say
to that. One is that I am not going to
permit myself to <i>be</i> sacrificed. Another
is that I demand, right here and now,
that you begin to discuss with me certain
agreements which are going to
regulate the future conduct of affairs
in this world to which I have come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low exclamation answered that, but
it came from no priest. They remained
sullen and staggered. It was Naida
who murmured, and there was excitement
and pleasure in her voice. Suddenly
she placed her lips against
Kirby&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not treat with them,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Tell them you want to see the
Duca, and will destroy them all unless
he comes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Understanding burst over Kirby. The
Duca! Then these men were only the
representatives of a High Priest, the
Duca!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he repeated resolutely to the
assembled greybeards, &ldquo;a meeting is
going to be held in this chamber of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span>
council at once. But I will not deal
with you! Do you understand me? I
must see the Duca. I leave it to you
to decide whether you will summon
him, or force me to fight my way
through to wherever he is staying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duca!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> words burst in dismay from
the gimlet-eyed cacique who had
said there would be no more fighting.
He looked at Naida, well aware of the
fact that it was her interference which
had made Kirby extend his demand.
And his look was black.</p>
<p>Kirby slid between Naida and the
cacique.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he spat out, &ldquo;the Duca! Will
you summon him, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not repeat what he would do
as an alternative. A second passed in
silence. It seemed as if the cacique
who had been speaking was ready to
burst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer me!&rdquo; Kirby thundered.</p>
<p>And then the priest obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he growled in a voice
which quaked with rage. &ldquo;I obey. But
you will wish you had never made the
demand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next second he swung on his
heel, and leaving his company behind
as a guard, headed toward a stair which
led upward from one side of the amphitheatre,
and which was protected by a
door of heavy, grilled metal work. The
stairway seemed to be spiral, and was
all enclosed. Kirby realized that it
must lead into the tall and beautiful
tower of obsidion which he had seen
outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Naida whispered as looks and
smiles of approval came from all of
the girls, &ldquo;you have been magnificent!
Mark now, what we must do. You must
be the one to state our terms, because
you have already won a victory for us.
Tell the Duca that we will not submit
to any compromise with the ape-men,
and least of all will we let any of our
number go to the ape-men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A deep flush crept into Kirby&rsquo;s cheeks
at thought of what he would like to do
to the man who had proposed that sacrifice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell him,&rdquo; Naida continued,
&ldquo;that we want men brought to our
world from the world above. And
finally tell him we will live under his
dictatorship no longer, and hereafter
demand a voice in all councils affecting
temporal affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Kirby spoke grimly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him. Naida, is this high priest
we&rsquo;re waiting for, the one who proposed
sacrifice of some of you to the
apes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naida nodded.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Next</span> moment, she, Kirby, and all
the others, including the row of
glowering caciques, became silent. At
sounds from above, all looked toward
the grilled doorway to the tower. Then
Kirby realized that all of the girls, as
well as the caciques, were dropping to
their knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he commanded quickly. &ldquo;Get
up! You must not abase&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had not finished, and Naida had
scarcely risen, when the heavy door
swung on noiseless hinges.</p>
<p>The light in the amphitheatre seemed
to become more intense. Then, against
the great glow, Kirby beheld majesty,
beheld one who represented the apotheosis
of priestly rank and power.</p>
<p>Clad in robes of filmy material which
glimmered white beside the gray robes
of his underlings, the Duca wore about
his waist the living flame of a girdle
composed of alternate cut diamonds
and blood red rubies each larger than
a golf ball. And Kirby, searching for
comparisons, realized that the Duca&rsquo;s
face, upheld to others, would be as remarkable
as his jewels must be when
compared to ordinary gems. It was a
chiseled face, seamed by a thousand
wrinkles, which a god might have
carved from ivory before endowing it
with the flush and glow of life. A
mane of snow white hair cascaded back
from a tremendous forehead to fall
about thin but square shoulders and
mingle with the downward sweep of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span>
pure white beard. The eyes, black as
polished jet, flamed now with the glare
of baleful fires.</p>
<p>As Naida, stealing close to Kirby,
trembled, and even the abased caciques
trembled, Kirby himself felt as if icy
water was trickling over him.</p>
<p>He fought the sensation off. For suddenly
he knew that in spite of first impressions
which made the man seem a
living god, the old Duca was human.
And what was more, he was in the
wrong. All of which being true, the
thing to do was keep a level head and
fight.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>All</span> at once Kirby spoke across the
silence in the great room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sent for you,&rdquo; he said, weighing
words carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo;&mdash;the Duca&rsquo;s voice was mellow
and deep&mdash;&ldquo;have come. But I am
not here because you summoned me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Kirby let sarcasm edge his
words. &ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t quibble about
your motives for coming. Did my
messenger tell you why we are here
and demand your presence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your messenger,&rdquo; the old man said
calmly, &ldquo;told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. Do you consent to listen
to Naida&rsquo;s and my terms? If you <i>will</i>
listen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wait a moment,&rdquo; the Duca interrupted,
still calmly, but with a look
in his eyes which Kirby did not like.
&ldquo;Are you asking <i>me</i>, to my face,
whether I will listen to terms which
you offer as self-styled victor of a battle
with my caciques?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby nodded. His apprehension increased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Duca softly. And
then, amazingly, a smile deepened
every wrinkle of his parchment face.
&ldquo;But do you not remember that I said
I had <i>not</i> come here because you summoned
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Kirby said solidly. &ldquo;I remember
very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing which brought me here
was the failure of my followers to accomplish
an assignment which I had
given them&mdash;namely, that of ending
your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum.&rdquo; Kirby scratched behind his
ear. &ldquo;You are <i>not</i> interested in arranging
terms of peace, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here,&rdquo;&mdash;suddenly the Duca&rsquo;s
voice filled the room&mdash;&ldquo;to do that
which my priests were unable to do.
And the moment has come when the
Gods will no longer trifle with you.
You dog! You thieving intruder!
You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swiftly the Duca plunged one withered
but still powerful hand into the
folds of his robe above the flaming
girdle. Then his hand flashed out, and
in it he held&mdash;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>But</span> Kirby did not get to see.</p>
<p>A strangled cry of terror smote
his ears. Naida leaped toward him
from one side, while Elana, the lovely
youngest girl, sprang from another
direction, hurled Naida aside, and
stopped in front of Kirby.</p>
<p>Through the glaring room flickered
a tiny red serpentine creature which
the Duca hurled from a crystalline
tube in his hand. As the minute snake
struck Elana&rsquo;s breast, she gave a
choked cough, and then, as she half
turned to smile at both Naida and
Kirby over her shoulder, her eyes went
blank, and she collapsed gently to the
polished stones of the floor&mdash;dead.</p>
<p>A second later came squirming out
from under her the ghastly, glimmering
little snake which had struck.</p>
<p>Slowly, while every mortal in the
room stood paralyzed, Kirby stepped
forward and set his heel upon the
writhing thing. When he raised his
boot, the snake was only a blotch on
the floor.</p>
<p>The Duca was standing as still as
girls and caciques. The laughter with
which he had started to greet what he
had thought would be Kirby&rsquo;s extermination
had faded to a look of wonder&mdash;and
fear. He was an easy mark.</p>
<p>Up to him Kirby rolled, and with
all the force of soul and muscular body,
drove his fist into the Duca&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;By God,&rdquo; he roared, &ldquo;you want war,
and you shall have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duca was simply out&mdash;not dead.
Since Kirby did not want him dead,
he did not strike again, but swung back
from the sprawled body, faced Naida,
and pointed to the tower door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up there!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Seize the
tower. I have a reason!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Duca&rsquo;s crashing downfall,
had come to the caciques a tension
which made Kirby know they would
not be dummy figures much longer.
His eyes never left them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Naida!&rdquo; he snapped again.
&ldquo;We must hold the tower!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naida, all of the girls, were staring
dazedly at Elana, dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tower!&rdquo; she choked. &ldquo;But we
cannot go there. It is the Duca&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is the Duca&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Kirby
said firmly, &ldquo;is exactly why we must
hold it. Come, Naida, please&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>And</span> then he saw comprehension
begin to dawn at last.</p>
<p>He also saw two of the caciques
glide from the wooden line, and slink
toward him past the unconscious Duca,
stealthily.</p>
<p>As Naida suddenly cried out to her
companions, pushed at two of them,
and then darted like a rainbow nymph
toward the silent and forbidding upward
spiral of steps, Kirby faced the
gliding caciques.</p>
<p>One he clutched with viselike hands,
and lifted him. As the other shrieked
and sprang, he was mowed down by
the hurtling body of his fellow priest
which Kirby flung forward mightily.</p>
<p>The rest of the caciques were howling.
While Naida waited beside the
tower door, the other girls flashed up
the steps. The Duca still lay where
he had fallen, a thread of blood oozing
from his mouth. Kirby, after his last
look over all, solemnly stooped and
gathered in his arms the limp, radiant
little body of the girl who had given
her life that her friends might be left
with a leader.</p>
<p>A moment later, he was standing on
the steps. Naida, unopposed by the
still stupefied caciques, swung shut the
tower door and shot a double bolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naida&mdash;&rdquo; Kirby whispered as he
held Elana closer to him, &ldquo;oh, I am so
sorry that we could have won only at
such a price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Naida stooped to kiss the pale
little forehead with its halo of golden
hair, sobs came. But then she raised
her eyes, and they were, for Kirby,
alight with the message that she could
and would accept Elana&rsquo;s sacrifice, because
she would gladly have made it
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not forget,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Carry her tenderly, and come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For better, for worse, the Duca&rsquo;s
tower was theirs.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>At</span> the end of an hour, Kirby was
taking a turn of guard duty at
the foot of the steps, while the others
remained with Elana in a chamber
above. To Kirby, with things thus far
along, it seemed that the seizure of the
tower had proved a shrewd stroke.</p>
<p>It seemed that the tower was to the
Duca what hair was to Sampson. From
Naida had come the information that
the Duca lived hidden within the great
shaft of obsidion, and appeared but seldom
even before his caciques. Apparently
a large part of his hold upon his
subjects was maintained by the mystery
with which he kept himself surrounded.
And now his retreat was lost
to him! Such had been the moral
effect of the loss upon both Duca and
caciques, that his whole first hour had
gone by without their doing anything.</p>
<p>Kirby, standing just around the first
turn of the winding stairway, presently
cocked his ears to listen to the
conclave being held in the amphitheatre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not starve them out, O Holy
One?&rdquo; he heard one of the caciques ask
of the Duca, only to be answered by a
growl of negation.</p>
<p>The Duca, Kirby had gathered before
this, wanted to fight.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But there is no food in the tower,
is there?&rdquo; the cacique still pressed on,
and this time he was supported by
other voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the Duca rumbled back. &ldquo;But
am I to be deprived of my retreat,
left here like a common dog amongst
other dogs, while these accursed fiends
starve slowly to death? No! I tell
you, you must fight for me!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>But</span> he had told them so several
times before and nothing had
happened. Kirby grinned at the
thought of the caste the Duca was losing
by being driven to this belittling
parley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy One,&rdquo; exclaimed a new priest
in answer to the urge to fight, &ldquo;what
can we do against the golden haired
fiend? The stairs are so narrow that
he could defend them alone. And then
there are the gates of bronze. If we
could shatter the first, at the foot of
the steps, we should only encounter
others. The Duca must remember that
his tower was built to withstand
attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; the Duca snapped back,
&ldquo;it must be attacked! I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But then he fell silent, having been
made so by the sounds of dissension
which arose amongst his caciques.
Kirby, laughing to himself, turned
away from his listening post, and tip-toed
up the steps.</p>
<p>After he had closed and bolted behind
him three of the bronze portals
so feared by the caciques, he turned
to the entrance of the chamber in
which he had left Naida and the others.
Here all was silent, and he found his
friends grouped about a couch on
which lay Elana. Feeling the solemnity
of the moment, he would have
taken his place quietly amongst the
mourners.</p>
<p>Naida, however, came to him at once,
and in a low voice asked for news from
the amphitheatre, and when Kirby answered
that the caciques were unanimously
in favor of leaving them alone
until they starved, she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then it is good news!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, however, a shadow of
doubt flickered in her great eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, is it? It means temporary
immunity, of coarse. But&mdash;starvation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby assured her with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we had to starve we might worry.
But there is more food here than the
Duca thinks. Look!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>From</span> a bulging pocket of his
tunic he fished a strip of the roots
on which he had subsisted so comfortably.
Naida&rsquo;s eyes widened, and
several of the girls gave low cries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Naida exclaimed, &ldquo;but such
food! Why&mdash;why, do you know what
you are offering us? Why, this is the
sacred Peyote! Only the Duca eats it,
and, at rare intervals, his priests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby was really startled now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely you and the others have
taken quantities of the stuff away from
the Valley of the Geyser. Do you
mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we gathered the Peyote
does not mean that we have ever tasted
it. We gather it for the Duca. To
taste would be complete, utter sacrilege.
Have <i>you</i> been eating it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inwardly Kirby was chuckling at
this added proof of the buncumbe with
which the Duca&mdash;and other Ducas&mdash;had
fooled all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ve been eating the
Peyote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and nothing has happened to
you?&rdquo; Naida asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly. I certainly haven&rsquo;t been
blasted by the Lords of the Sun and
Moon, or the Serpent either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naida and all the others were silent.
The conflict between their reverence
for the food and their clear desire to
eat it, now that it was become the food
of their leader, was pathetic.</p>
<p>Kirby put one of the strips in Naida&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;We have
bested the Duca in fair fight. We have
seized his tower. Why not eat his
food?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span></div>
<p>As he had hoped it would, the suggestion
at last settled the matter. A
moment later, as Naida nibbled her
first bite, she smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&mdash;it&rsquo;s good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the question of provisions settled
at least for a time, Kirby&rsquo;s next
thought was of the tower. The present
lull of peace seemed made for exploration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; he said to Naida,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve plenty to do,&rdquo; and then, when he
explained, they set out, accompanied
by Nini, a cousin of Naida&rsquo;s, and Ivana,
a younger sister.</p>
<p>All of the others remained with little
Elana.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>While</span> they climbed spiral
stairs, Naida explained that the
chamber they had just left was used
by the Duca as a place in which he
prayed before and after contacts with
caciques or subjects. A sort of halfway
station between earth and heaven,
as it were, where the Duca might
be purged of any sullying influence
gained from human relationships.</p>
<p>At thought of the rank, egotistical
hypocrisy implied by the story, Kirby
smiled grimly. Then they came to a
new door, heavier than that which barricaded
the prayer chamber. Unlocked,
the thing swung ponderously at Kirby&rsquo;s
push, and with the three girls pressing
close beside him, he entered&mdash;and
stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naida!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>oh</i>!&rdquo; she cried, and while Nini
and Ivana gasped, she clapped her
hands in an instinctive, feminine reaction
of joy. &ldquo;But there are things
here which I believe none but the Ducas
of our race have ever seen! Oh!
Why, the sacred girdle is as nothing
compared to this display!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By &ldquo;display&rdquo; she meant a treasure
which took Kirby&rsquo;s breath away, which
made his heart act queerly.</p>
<p>The walls of the chamber were fashioned
of polished blocks of obsidion
on which stood out in heavy bas-relief
a maze of decorative figures fashioned
of pure, beaten gold&mdash;the same kind of
gold which had gone into the making
of the cylinder of gold. With his first
glance at the gorgeously wrought motifs
of Feathered Serpent and Sun and
Moon symbols, Kirby knew to a certainty
whence the golden cylinder had
come originally.</p>
<p>But even the gold&mdash;literally tons of
it there must have been&mdash;was nothing
compared to the gems.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>They</span> were spread out in blinding
array upon a great table in the
center of the room. There were pearls
as big as turkey eggs and whiter, softer
than the light of a June morning growing
in the East. There were rubies.
One amongst the many was the size of
a baseball and glowed like the heart
of a red star. The least of the two or
three hundred gems would have outclassed
the greatest treasures of the
Crown jewels of England and Russia
combined.</p>
<p>Most overwhelming of all, however,
was the jewel which rested against a
square of black cloth all its own in the
center of the table. While his heart
still acted queerly, while Naida, Nini,
and Ivana hung back, delighted, but
still too bewildered to move, Kirby
advanced and took gingerly in his
hands a single white diamond about
eighteen inches long, and almost as
wide and deep as it was long.</p>
<p>The thing was carved with exquisite
cunning to a likeness of the living
head of Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered
Serpent.</p>
<p>Kirby dared not guess how many
pounds the carven hunk of flashing,
blue-white carbon weighed. He knew
only that like it there was no other
diamond in the world, and that the
thing was real. Naida and the two
girls were silent now, and suddenly
Kirby realized that to their awe of the
gem was added awe of deepest religious
nature. Slowly he put the diamond
head of the Serpent back upon
its square of cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we had heard that this thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393' name='page_393'></a>393</span>
existed,&rdquo; Naida said presently, voice
hushed, &ldquo;but no one except the holy
men of our race has ever beheld it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, what is it?&rdquo; Kirby asked.
&ldquo;Whence came it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, when Naida would have
answered, he interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wait! Tell me as we go. We
could stay here for the rest of our
lives without much trouble, but we&rsquo;ve
got to cover the rest of the tower and
get back to the others.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>It</span> was after they had closed the
door to the treasure room that
Naida told him the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not so much to tell,&rdquo; she
began. &ldquo;The diamond itself is so gorgeous
that it is hard to talk about.
But here is the story. A great many
ages ago one of the Ducas of our race
found the diamond, decided to carve
it into a perfect likeness of the head
of the Serpent God. All of the craftsmen
of the race helped him and when
they were done, they took their image
to Quetzalcoatl himself, and showed
him what they had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quetzalcoatl was pleased. So
pleased, that he promised all of the
wise men that he would cease to prey
upon them as he had in the past, and
henceforward would take his toll of
sacrifice from the ape-men alone. Them
he hated and would continue to hate
because they worshipped not him but
Xlotli.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it came about,&rdquo; Naida went
on slowly, looking up at Kirby as they
still mounted wide steps to the upper
reaches of the tower, &ldquo;that our people
gained immunity from a God which
had always before harmed and destroyed
them. Our race presently began
to build this castle here on the
high plateau, and Quetzalcoatl kept his
compact with them. He still comes out
of his chasm at intervals and preys
upon the ape-men, but no one of our
race has seen him for thousands of
years, and he has always let us alone.
And there is the whole myth and explanation
of why the great diamond is
revered among us as a holy of holies.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>They</span> had mounted to a new door
which Kirby guessed might give
entrance to the Duca&rsquo;s living quarters.
But he was in no mood to open it at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; he said as they all
paused. &ldquo;You say that, although none
of your race has seen Quetzalcoatl
since the diamond head was carved, he
still comes out of his chasm and makes
trouble for the ape-men. Just what
does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;&rdquo; Naida looked at him wonderingly.
&ldquo;I mean what I have said.
The Serpent comes out of his chasm
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What chasm?&rdquo; Kirby asked sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the one we crossed this morning.
It extends to the far reaches of
our country, beyond the Rorroh forest,
where the ape-men dwell but which
our people never visit. It is in that distant
part of the chasm that the Serpent
dwells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;Oh, good Lord!&rdquo; Kirby
whistled softly. &ldquo;Naida, do you mean
to tell me that Quetzalcoatl was not
simply a mythical monster, but an
actual, living serpent which is alive
<i>now</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naida and the others shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Sometimes
we have captured a few ape-men,
and they tell us stories of how Quetzalcoatl
kills them. <i>They</i> say he is very
much alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Kirby mumbled in increasing
wonder, &ldquo;is this living creature the
same which your ancestors worshipped
first as long ago, perhaps, as a million
years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Naida answered unhesitatingly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure of. Our caciques
believe that the Serpent, although it
lives longer than any other sentient
thing, finally dies and is succeeded by
a new Serpent which is reproduced by
itself, within its own body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So overwhelming did Kirby find this
unexpected sequel to their discovery
of the great diamond head, so staggered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394' name='page_394'></a>394</span>
was he by the fact that Quetzalcoatl,
of Aztecan myth, might exist as
a sentient creature here in this cavern
world, that he had little heart left for
exploring other wonders.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Nevertheless</span>, he presently
pushed open the new door before
which they had paused, and behind
it found, as he had expected, the
Duca&rsquo;s living quarters.</p>
<p>These were as severe as the jewel
chamber had been gorgeous. A thin
pallet spread upon a frame of wood
formed the bed, and beside it stood a
single stiff chair. That was all. The
walls of glistening obsidion were bare.</p>
<p>There was, however, a door in one
circular wall, and as Kirby flung this
open, his previous disappointment
changed to delight. For shelves along
the walls of the small chamber held
roll after roll of parchment covered
with script. And in one corner lay six
undamaged, almost new Mannlichers
and several hundred rounds of ammunition!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naida,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;do you know
what those are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that they are weapons of
the sort you used against the ape-men
this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are the same kind I used, and
then some. With these weapons we
can do what we never could with the
smaller one. How did they get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They came when I was much
younger,&rdquo; Naida answered with a shade
of sadness in her voice. &ldquo;The men who
had them penetrated the Valley of the
Geyser, coming by a different route
from the one you followed. When
the Duca learned they were there, he
sent such men of the race as were still
able to fight to kill them. That order
of the Duca&rsquo;s was one of the first
things to turn me against him. The
men were not harming us, and they
should have been permitted to go away.
But the Duca insisted that they be
killed, and in the fight were lost eight
of our youngest and strongest men.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Kirby</span> stooped to inspect the
rifles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has no one learned to use these
weapons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Naida answered. &ldquo;The Duca
kept them for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think,&rdquo; put in Ivana, &ldquo;that he
hoped to learn to use them, and was
afraid for us to have the knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby filled one of the magazines,
and felt the heft of the gun with pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It looks to
me as though your time to learn the
art of shooting has come at last. Come,
I think we had better be getting back
downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby took three guns himself, and
with the others lugging the rest, they
started back. The parchment rolls, he
decided, must be left for examination
later on.</p>
<p>They were all elated when they rejoined
the girls in the prayer chamber,
and high spirits were still further increased
by the report, promptly given,
that all had remained quiet in the
amphitheatre. Save only for the presence
of Elana, radiant and calm in
death, the give and take of questions
would have been accompanied by actual
gaiety.</p>
<p>But the time of peace did not last
much longer. While Naida was in the
midst of answering incessant questions
about the wonders of the jewel chamber,
Kirby heard a sound from below,
and suddenly went over to the downward-winding
steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he called sharply back to
the others.</p>
<p>He had not been mistaken. Many
footsteps echoed from the amphitheatre,
and he made out that the
caciques were coming toward the bolted
gate at the foot of the steps. While he
listened, and Naida came eagerly to
his side, silence fell.</p>
<p>But then clear words came up to
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the upper-world man come to
the foot of the steps,&rdquo; called the Duca.
&ldquo;I have an offer to make him!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395' name='page_395'></a>395</span></div>
<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>To</span> himself Kirby chuckled. Such
real entreaty filled the Duca&rsquo;s
voice that there seemed no danger of
further treachery from him at the moment.</p>
<p>With a grin, Kirby took Naida&rsquo;s
hand and led her down the steps, unbolting
each bronze gate but the last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he asked in a
cool voice a moment later, when he
stopped on the final step and faced the
Duca from behind the protection of the
final gate.</p>
<p>Clearly the parley was going to be
a blunt one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to leave our world,&rdquo; the
Duca rumbled promptly.</p>
<p>He was drawn up in a posture intended
to display dignity. But his left
cheek, where Kirby had hammered
him, was pulpy and discolored, and
somehow he seemed to Kirby more
than ever merely human.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under what conditions am I to
leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will vacate my tower at
once,&rdquo; the Duca said with a flush of
eagerness which he could not conceal,
&ldquo;I will permit Naida and one of my
caciques to escort you back to the Valley
of the Geyser. I will also give you
directions by which you may travel in
safety from there to the outer world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby, wanting more details, made
himself seem thoughtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will happen to me, and
to the girls, if I decline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Encouraged, the Duca made an impressive
gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be left in the tower to die
of starvation. Mine is not a complicated
offer. It should require no complicated
decision. What is your answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby dropped his carefully assumed
mask of thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My answer is this,&rdquo; he lashed out.
&ldquo;I will not leave! The tower is ours,
and we will hold it until you have accepted
Naida&rsquo;s peace terms on your
priestly oath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you stay in the tower you will
starve!&rdquo; thundered the Duca.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we won&rsquo;t starve! We won&rsquo;t
starve because we eat the food of Ducas!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>In</span> silence, Kirby took from his
pocket a strip of the sacred Peyote
and bit off one end of it. Suddenly
the hush in the amphitheatre became
complete. As he watched Kirby chewing,
the Duca gasped and choked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; Kirby announced with
slow emphasis, &ldquo;I have taken possession
of the weapons which you took from
men of the upper world, and which
have already sent men of your race to
their death. I have no wish to kill
either you or your caciques, but if you
do not presently discuss peace with me,
you will certainly find yourself embroiled
in a struggle more bitter than
the mild one of this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that said, he swung on his
heel, and taking Naida&rsquo;s hand again,
started with her up the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing more to say,&rdquo; he
called over his shoulder to a Duca
whose white haired majesty had been
stripped from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting on,&rdquo; he whispered to
Naida a moment later. &ldquo;The best thing
for us is just to sit still now, and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the questions he wanted to ask
Naida about her world becoming insistent,
he found himself, as a matter
of fact, glad for the prospect of further
respite. As both of them rejoined
the girls in the Duca&rsquo;s prayer chamber,
the first thing he did was to take from
his tunic the cylinder of gold which
he had found in the canyon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this, Naida?&rdquo; he asked,
hoping to start talk that would make
all of them forget the Duca and politics,
and at the same time help him to
learn much that he wished to know.</p>
<p>But a queer thing happened. Naida&rsquo;s
reaction to the carven gold was as unexpected
as it was marked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Oh!</i>&rdquo; she cried in a voice which
suddenly trembled with surprise, with
blank dismay. Somehow, the cylinder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span>
of gold brought to her face things
which not even the Serpent&rsquo;s head of
the diamond had evoked.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> prospect of a long session of
talk began to fade out in Kirby&rsquo;s
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Naida, whatever is there about
this fragment of gold to startle you as
it does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time all of the thirty-odd
other girls had come flocking about
them, and all were staring at the cylinder
as fascinatedly as Naida.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see what he has there?&rdquo;
Naida finally asked, ignoring Kirby in
her continued excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we <i>see</i>?&rdquo; answered the girl she
had addressed. &ldquo;Naida, surely it is the
carving which was lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naida was quivering with feeling
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you realize what it means to our
cause that it should have been returned
to us in this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl to whom she had spoken,
and the others, simply looked at her,
but in one face after another presently
dawned awe and joy.</p>
<p>Kirby stood still, puzzled and interested,
until at last Naida was recovered
enough to speak to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get this thing which
you call &lsquo;a fragment of gold&rsquo;?&rdquo; she
asked in a hushed voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found it,&rdquo; Kirby answered, &ldquo;lying
beside the skeleton of an upper-world
man, while I was ascending the
canyon which brought me to the Valley
of the Geyser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you do not know what the cylinder
is? But no, of course you could
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i> is it, Naida?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Naida</span> glanced at her friends,
then laid her hand on Kirby&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next to the great diamond, it is the
most cherished possession of our race.
In some respects it is even more holy
than the Serpent&rsquo;s head. The cylinder
happens to be the first work in gold
which was ever produced by our people.
It was made when the race was
new. It was because our first wise men
had found they could create things of
beauty like this cylinder, that they decided
to attempt the creation of the
Serpent&rsquo;s head, which is supposed to
have brought all of our blessings upon
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby thought he was beginning to
understand the excitement which his
introduction of the cylinder had created.
He also thought he could see
what Naida had meant by implying
that the cylinder could be made to aid
their cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he asked in a mood approaching
reverence, &ldquo;how the cylinder
came to be lying beside a dead
man&rsquo;s bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was stolen,&rdquo; Naida answered in
the breathless silence which the others
were keeping. &ldquo;When I was very
young, an upper-world man found his
way here, and the Duca captured and
meant to sacrifice him. But while they
were leading him to the temple where
such special ceremonies are held&mdash;the
building stands on another plateau, beyond
this&mdash;the man broke away. Some
of the priests in the procession were
carrying the cylinder, for it was an
occasion of great importance. The
prisoner knocked them down, got the
cylinder away from them, and finally
escaped by the same route over which
you came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he escaped,&rdquo; said Kirby wonderingly,
&ldquo;only to be killed by a rattlesnake
before he ever reached the civilized
world. But do you mean that you
never knew your sacred cylinder was
so close to you all these years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naida shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never got to the canyon of
which you speak, for a special reason
which I shall explain some day. And
besides that, I think the Duca was
afraid of this man who fought so
bravely. So he counted the cylinder
as lost. And that is one of the reasons
why he killed the men with the rifles,
who appeared in the Valley a few years
later.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Kirby</span> looked at her thoughtfully.
The mood for discussing all the
wonders of this lower world, which
had made him bring out the cylinder
originally, had quite vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that anyone
who was responsible for the return of
the cylinder to its rightful owners,
would be held in some respect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naida nodded vigorously, while little
lightnings of excitement flickered
in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might be held in more than respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, then, do you suggest that we
do next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the small lightnings darted,
and Naida reached for the cylinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind if I take it for a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Promptly then she faced around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here, everyone,&rdquo; she ordered.</p>
<p>And with that she waved the cylinder
in a flashing little arc before their
eyes, and darted to the door.</p>
<p>It was all so unexpected that she
was gone before Kirby could speak.
Slowly, with all of the suddenly gay
company of girls following after him,
he went to the doorway, and stood on
the steps leading to the amphitheatre.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>A minute</span> passed. He heard
voices downstairs. He heard Naida&rsquo;s
voice ringing clearly, though he
could not distinguish her words. He
heard a great cry from a score of male
throats. More minutes passed. Words
that were low and tense poured out in
a rumbling volume. Above the rumble,
Naida&rsquo;s voice presently sounded
again, clear and sweet, but incisive.
Then, when no more than five or six
minutes had gone, Kirby heard the
clang of the bronze gate at the foot
of the steps, heard light, swift footsteps
ascending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naida!&rdquo; he called softly.</p>
<p>She flashed upward toward him
around the last curve in the stairway.
Straight to his outstretched arms she
went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is done! It is done!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us!&rdquo; cried first one girl and
then others.</p>
<p>Naida drew away from Kirby at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told the Duca,&rdquo; she said to all of
them, &ldquo;that our leader would keep the
cylinder for a period of time equal to
one upper-world year. If the Duca
grants all the terms of peace which
we will ask of him, and if he accepts
the upper-world man as our temporal
ruler, and all goes well for a year, then
we will consider replacing the cylinder
where it belongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what,&rdquo; Kirby asked exultantly,
&ldquo;does the Duca say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, without warning, Naida
dropped before him on one knee, and
from that position gazed up at him
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he will make you our King,
to govern all temporal affairs within
our realm! He is waiting for you to
come and hold a conclave now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still kneeling half in fun, half in
sincere reverence, Naida held out the
precious, potent cylinder of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guard it carefully!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;So long as you keep it away from the
Duca, making him hope to win it back,
he will consent to almost anything.
Yes, he is waiting with the caciques
in the amphitheatre now; waiting to
draw up terms of peace.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>To</span> be King amongst these people!
A queer sensation tugged at Kirby&rsquo;s
heart as he descended the steps
with Naida at his right, and all of her&mdash;and
his&mdash;dainty and gracious friends
following after. Yet, intense as his
emotion was, never for a second was
he able to doubt the evidence of his
senses which told him that all of this
was real. As they descended the black
steps of the tower, Naida&rsquo;s sweetness,
her grace, the warm humanity of her,
made him humble with gratitude for
the extraordinary fortune which had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398' name='page_398'></a>398</span>
come to him, an unromantic aviator
born in Kansas.</p>
<p>Then they were standing in the brilliant
light of the amphitheatre, and
the Duca, surrounded by his caciques,
was advancing to meet them.</p>
<p>It was not a long conference which
followed. Kirby saw from the start
that the Duca was indeed ready to
come to terms. So treasured an object,
it seemed, was the cylinder of gold,
that the mere fact that Kirby possessed
it made the Duca respect the possessor,
whether he would or no. With this
initial advantage, it did not take long
to make demands and win acceptance.</p>
<p>It was agreed that some systematic
campaign of extermination should be
planned and carried out against the
ape-men. Further, the project for
eventually bringing other upper-world
men to the realm was accepted. Most
notable of all, it was agreed that while
the Duca should retain a voice in the
regulation of temporal affairs, Kirby
should possess an absolute veto over
his word.</p>
<p>Naida said there must be some formal
ceremony to celebrate Kirby&rsquo;s
ascendency to power. To this the Duca
consented, and established the date as
a fortnight hence, and the place as the
temple on the plateau beyond the plateau
of the castle, where the Ducas had
been invested with their robes of state
from time immemorial. At the end, it
was decided that little Elana should
be left in the prayer chamber until a
burial ceremony could be held on the
morrow.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>In</span> less than an hour, Kirby, Naida,
and the others withdrew from the
amphitheatre to return to the regular
dwelling places of the girls. Deep in
his mind, Kirby did not know how sincere
the Duca was, and fear lingered,
somehow, but he put it aside for the
present.</p>
<p>As they came out of the castle, proceeding
in a gay procession across the
drawbridge above the moat of beautiful
aquatic plants, Kirby saw that the
light from the glass sky was fading
to a glow like that of spring twilight
in the upper world. Naida answered
his question about the phenomenon by
saying that day and night in the cavern
corresponded to the same period
above. What quality of the glass sky
gave out light, she did not know, but it
seemed definite that the element was
sensitive to the presence of light in
the upper world, and when the sun
sank there, the glow faded here.</p>
<p>A flower embroidered path led them
around the castle to a group of little
crystalline houses all overgrown with
bougainvillea vines and honeysuckle.
In front of the first, Naida paused, and
while the others went on to the other
houses, she looked at Kirby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Elana&rsquo;s dwelling,&rdquo; she said
simply, &ldquo;and it will be vacant now.
Elana would want you to take it. Will
you, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The twilight was deepening swiftly.
Kirby nodded reverently, then drew
close to Naida.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naida?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can stay here, I can consent to
become, after a fashion, a King, only
if you will reign with me as Queen.
Will you, Naida? Will you love me
as I have learned to love you during
this single day in Paradise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer. But presently
Kirby&rsquo;s mind went blank for sheer joy.
For then Naida raised her face, and he
kissed her lips.</p>
<p>It made no difference then that, despite
the day&rsquo;s victory, Kirby could see
trouble ahead, and feared, rather than
rejoiced at, the Duca&rsquo;s too easy acceptance
of terms. The future could take
care of itself. This moment in the
dusk belonged to him and Naida.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> two weeks which passed for
Kirby after that particular twilight
sped quickly. During the first
morning, all attended the ceremony
which was held for Elana&rsquo;s burial in
the plot of gardened ground where lay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399' name='page_399'></a>399</span>
her ancestors. Ensuing mornings were
devoted to conferences in the amphitheatre
with Duca and caciques.</p>
<p>After the fourth day Kirby, at Naida&rsquo;s
insistence, moved into splendid
quarters in the castle&mdash;a suite of chambers
across the amphitheatre from those
in which the caciques dwelt. In practically
forcing the move on Kirby,
Naida won his consent finally by agreeing
to have their wedding ceremony
performed on the day of his coronation;
then she would come to the castle
with him.</p>
<p>The afternoons of that first fortnight
before the wedding and coronation
were spent in hunting and fishing.
Also Kirby and Naida visited often the
aged people of the race, who dwelt in
crystalline, vine covered houses like
those of the girls, but removed from
them. Naida&rsquo;s relatives were dead, but
she had relatives there, and to all these
aged ones, who sat living in the past,
she did what she could to explain present
developments in the affairs of the
younger generation.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Kirby set aside
certain hours each afternoon which he
devoted to the formation of a rifle
squad amongst the girls. Six rifles he
had, and in turn he trained each of the
girls in their use, having set up a range
at the foot of the plateau cliffs. The
results he gained made him feel that
the day would come soon enough when
he would dare launch an offensive
against the ape-people; and especially
pleasing was the sense of power over
the Duca which he gained. The Duca
showed no sign of treachery. Yet
Kirby did not trust him. Never did he
quite forget the misgivings which had
lingered in his mind after the first conclave.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>As</span> for his relationship with Naida,
that grew with every moment
they could steal to spend with each
other. And side by side with their
growing knowledge of each other grew,
for Kirby, an increasing store of
knowledge of the realm.</p>
<p>He learned, amongst other things,
what seemed the origin of the worship
of the Serpent, Quetzalcoatl, amongst
primitive Mexican races. The time had
been when the People of the Temple
had mingled freely with the races
above them; and, that they might have
ready means of egress to the world,
they had built the tunnel through
which Kirby had entered the Valley
of the Geyser. Thus, going and coming
as they did, they had spread their
cult of the worship of Quetzalcoatl;
and when, eventually, strife arose between
the peoples of upper world and
lower, and the People of the Temple
withdrew to their realm, they left behind
them the Serpent myth which was
to live through countless centuries.</p>
<p>The tunnel, Naida said, had been
abandoned when her people left the
upper world once and for all, and its
use for any reason prohibited. This,
Naida gave as the reason why none of
them went near the tunnel now, and
why the cylinder of gold had lain in
the canyon undiscovered. It was the
explanation she had promised on the
day in the tower, when first she saw
the cylinder.</p>
<p>So the days passed, until the day set
aside for wedding and coronation
dawned. On that morning, Kirby, having
concluded a long conference with
the Duca, was walking with Naida in
the gardens outside the castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said to her: &ldquo;do you
yourself believe that this Serpent has
the powers of a God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naida looked at him quickly, a sudden
fright in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the Serpent exists to-day,
somewhere in the distant reaches of
the chasm, beyond the Rorroh forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but do you believe the Serpent
is God?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Actually</span> frightened now, she
looked swiftly about. But when
she saw that they were alone, confidence
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I do not believe
Quetzalcoatl is a god. I believe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_400' name='page_400'></a>400</span>
he is the most terrible creature anywhere
in our realm, and that men first
worshipped him through fear. I believe
our race would be better a hundred
times if they had never made him
their God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do <i>not</i> believe that the
Ducas of past ages talked with him.
You do not believe it was Quetzalcoatl&rsquo;s
pleasure over the great diamond
which made him cease preying on your
people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Long habit makes me show
respect for these myths, and adhere to
the customs of our cult, but I do not
believe. I think our race gained immunity
for the Serpent&rsquo;s ravages, not
through a compact with Quetzalcoatl,
but because our builders were intelligent
enough to erect the castle up here
on the plateau, where Quetzalcoatl
could not reach them. To tell the
truth, I think the whole cult is false
and wrong, and I wish Quetzalcoatl
were dead and gone from the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby smiled. In spite of Naida&rsquo;s
reverence for certain features of the
cult, he had long suspected that her
true feelings were those she had just
expressed. And he was glad for this
new bond of understanding between
them. He glanced at her with understanding
and perfect trust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naida, since we have talked so
frankly, there is one more thing which
I must bring out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duca.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>She</span> drew closer, her perfumed body
brushing his, her great eyes caressing
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naida, I am afraid of the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so am I!&rdquo; she confessed suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has all been too easy,&rdquo; Kirby said
in a slow voice. &ldquo;There is no doubt
whatever that our possession of the
cylinder of gold has had great influence
on the Duca, and yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, taking her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she went on for him,
&ldquo;you do not believe he would have conceded
what he has, unless he intends to
make trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby nodded twice, emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you have trained all of us to
use the rifles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled gravely at her understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have. And your skill, and
that of the others, with the rifles, will
always help us. Yet even so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Closer still she drew now, and there
was sadness in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I see,&rdquo; she said in a voice
which choked. &ldquo;When do you think
he will make a move to start trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby hesitated, then drew a long
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On&mdash;on the day of our union?&rdquo;
Naida echoed in dismay. &ldquo;Can you
tell where or how he will strike at us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a hundred things he
could do. Naida, I&mdash;I&mdash;Well, somehow
I am afraid of the ceremony this
afternoon&mdash;the wedding ceremony!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>He</span> felt a little shiver go through
her, and would have taken her
in his arms, save that a gay cry rang
in the garden then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naida, Naida!&rdquo; It was her cousin,
Nini, a bronze-haired youngster as elfin
and Pucklike as her name. &ldquo;I thought
we should never find you! Do you
realize this is your <i>wedding</i> day, and
that you&rsquo;re acting as if there was nothing
to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nini darted a mocking glance at
Kirby, who grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do come, Naida!&rdquo; cried another girl.
&ldquo;Your gown is ready, and we want you
to ourselves for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other girls joined them, some singing
and some carrying an obligato on
the sweet, flutelike instruments which
Kirby had first heard as he hung in
the throat of the geyser. In front of
them all, Kirby laughed and kissed
Naida on the forehead. But as he took
leave of her thus, he whispered:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_401' name='page_401'></a>401</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We must not let our guard relax
for a second this afternoon. And I
think there is a more definite precaution
which I will take, besides.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Some</span> hours later, Kirby smiled
with tight-lipped satisfaction at
thought of that precaution which he
had taken. What it was only he, Nini,
Ivana, and three other girls knew,
which secrecy pleased him as much as
the precautionary measure itself.</p>
<p>Seated alone in a dimly-lighted,
thick-walled cell of the ancient temple
in which the dual ceremony of wedding
and coronation would take place,
he was waiting for the moment when
the festivities would begin. Thus far
the Duca had done nothing. Yet Kirby&rsquo;s
uneasiness would not leave him,
and he continued to be thankful that,
if trouble should start, the Duca might
not find as many trumps in his hand as
he expected.</p>
<p>A couple of hours after Kirby had
left Naida and the other girls in the
garden, all had begun the two-mile
journey from the castle to the small
plateau on which stood this temple,
where the ceremony would be held.
Now, while Kirby waited alone, the
Duca and his caciques had gone to another
wing of the temple. Naida, attended
by her bridesmaids, had been
assigned to a cell of their own, and the
rest of the girls were waiting in the
nave of the temple. Unable to attend
the walk from their plateau to
this, the old people of the race had remained
in their crystal houses.</p>
<p>With ten minutes more to wait,
Kirby rose from a bench on which he
had been seated, and began to pace his
cell. It was this archaic pile of stone,
he finally decided, which was causing
his depression. Unlike the bright and
cheerful castle, this place, older than
any other building in the realm, was
squat, thick-walled, and gloomy. Here,
in the dusky cells which lined labyrinthine
corridors, the early generations
of the race had found protection from
outside dangers. All of which was all
right, Kirby thought, but just the same
he wished he had insisted upon being
wedded in the brilliant and cheerful
amphitheatre.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>But</span> presently he stopped pacing
and faced the door of his cell.
Then he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>From down the twisting corridors
which wound out to the central nave,
stole the high sweetness of soprano
voices, the whisper of flutes, and the
mellow resonance of little gongs of
jade and gold. It was the signal for
which he had waited.</p>
<p>It had been the Duca&rsquo;s instructions
that he should come out into the temple
when the music began, and meet
Naida there. Both would advance to
the altar, and when they were in place,
the Duca would come to them. Kirby,
therefore, after a glance at the blue
trousers and tunic of tanager scarlet
which the girls had made for him,
opened the door of his cell, and stepped
out.</p>
<p>In a moment he traversed the windings
of the corridor, and halted under
a flat arch at one side of the temple
nave.</p>
<p>As he paused so, to await the appearance
of Naida and her bridesmaids under
a similar arch directly across the
temple, he held his breath. Not even
nymphs could be as graceful as were
the twenty-six girls who were performing
the dance of Life Immortal,
which tradition decreed should be
given before the ceremony by which,
in this realm, two souls were wedded.
The flash of rainbow gowns was like
the swirling of light in a sky at dawning.
The music of voices, flutes, and
the little gongs of jade, would have
stirred the souls of the dead.</p>
<p>If only the confounded sense of approaching
disaster would leave him,
Kirby thought grimly, this would be
a magnificent moment. As it was, he
turned his eyes away from the girls,
and began to examine the temple.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_402' name='page_402'></a>402</span></div>
<p>Just as Naida had told him the case
would be, he found both sides of the
nave surrounded by arches similar to
the one under which he was standing.
Everywhere, dim and tortuous corridors
led to cells like the one he had
just left. Then, in one end of the nave,
loomed a closed door from behind
which the Duca and caciques would
appear when the couple to be wedded
were in place, before the altar.</p>
<p>The altar itself, a rectangular mass
of some jadelike stone, stood at a distance
of perhaps twenty paces in front
of the closed door. On top of the
greenish stones, resting on a cushion
of some crimson material, flashed the
crown which would be used at the coronation.
Kirby&rsquo;s eyes widened as he
beheld a single rose-cut diamond two
inches in diameter, mounted in an exquisitely
simple bandeau of wrought
gold. But, a moment later, even the
crown which would be his&mdash;if nothing
happened&mdash;seemed only a bauble compared
to the other prize which he had
won in this world beneath the world.</p>
<p>Naida!</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>He</span> realized that the dance was
ended, the music stilled, and that
the rainbow garbed girls had formed
a double line in the center of the temple.
Suddenly his heart beat fast, and
for just a moment, as he dared look
full and deeply at Naida, and she
smiled back at him across the distance,
he even forgot to be depressed.</p>
<p>But even as he advanced to meet her,
his uneasiness returned.</p>
<p>Now the girls were singing again,
their voices raised in a triumphant
chorale as beautiful as Naida&rsquo;s face
with its warm red lips and smiling
eyes, as beautiful as her wedding gown
that might have been woven, in its
filminess, of mist from the sea. The
bridesmaids, silent, their lovely faces
alight, paused. But Naida came on.</p>
<p>From her floated to Kirby a fragrance
more overwhelming than even
the perfume of the geyser. Presently
he felt her hand on his arm, and at last
they stood side by side. Now again,
his premonition of evil left him for a
flash; but again it returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am still afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naida&rsquo;s smile faded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I too. Oh, I&rsquo;ve been terribly
afraid! We will keep our guard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>In</span> front of them, on the altar, the
crown diamond winked and shimmered
in a dim light. The swelling
chorus of triumph, in which the bridesmaids
had joined now, made the whole
temple ring. Slowly, while Naida
moved easily beside him, Kirby began
to march to the altar.</p>
<p>Then it was done, and they were
halted. After both of them had given
a lingering glance at the crown whose
diamond shimmered now within their
reach, they raised their eyes to the
closed door behind the altar.</p>
<p>The thing was swinging open. An
inch it moved, two inches.</p>
<p>Kirby waited, never taking his eyes
away from the widening crack. With
a crashing final volume of sound, the
chorus swept magnificently to its climax.
Then the door was flung wide.</p>
<p>Still Kirby stood stiffly before the
altar, with Naida drawn up splendidly
beside him. After two seconds, however,
he moved.</p>
<p>Duca and caciques were not standing
in the corridor.</p>
<p>In the semi-darkness, the only figures
visible there were squatting, grotesque
things whose bodies were covered
with whitish hair and whose leathery
faces were disfigured by gashes of
mouths filled with enormous teeth.</p>
<p>A feeling of standing face to face
with final disaster, turned Kirby sick.
As he jerked back from the altar,
sweeping a paralyzed Naida with him,
the ape-men let out gibbering howls,
half-human. With gigantic, hopping
strides, the foremost rank of the creatures
swung forward, straight into the
temple.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403' name='page_403'></a>403</span></div>
<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Kirby</span>, already falling back toward
the other girls, caught
Naida up in his arms, and ran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nini!&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;Ivana! Get
the rifles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the two whom he had ordered
sprang to a corridor, and four others
followed, Kirby fell in with the others
and dropped Naida on her feet. Sick
as he was, there was still a ray of hope,
because the hard-headed precaution he
had taken against treachery this morning
was to have Nini and Ivana bring
the rifles here and hide them.</p>
<p>The first of the ape-men, snarling,
laughing, had hopped beyond the altar,
and the yellow foam of madness was
slavering from his jaws. Over his
shoulder he howled some jargon which
made his hairy legion struggle to catch
up with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got any puff balls?&rdquo;
Kirby snapped at Naida.</p>
<p>She shook her head numbly, just as
Nini and Ivana swung forward with
the Mannlichers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But you had sense enough to
bring the rifles! Oh, what does it
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duca has sold himself out to
the ape-man! He was helpless against
us, and has brought them to destroy
us for him. Here, Ivana, give me a
rifle! Everyone for herself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment he had a Mannlicher
at his shoulder.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>As</span> the thing kicked, an ape who
would have reached him in two
more jumps crashed over with his heart
torn out, the temple echoed with sound
which threatened to rip its solid walls
apart, and bright flashes at Kirby&rsquo;s
right and left told him that other rifles
were getting under way.</p>
<p>He fired again, twice more, slaughtering
an ape with each shot. The five
other rifles were creating havoc.</p>
<p>Blocked by a dozen torn and bleeding
bodies on the floor, the reenforcements
which still poured from the corridor,
began to mill around amongst
themselves, and the forward charge
slowed down. All the panic which had
sent the ape-men scuttling from the
beach at their first experience of gunfire,
seemed ready to break loose again
now.</p>
<p>Kirby felt it was good enough for
the work of a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get into line as I showed you how!&rdquo;
he shouted. &ldquo;Rifles in the front rank,
the others behind them. We&rsquo;re all right
now! Keep firing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep behind me!&rdquo; he ordered
Naida, still unarmed.</p>
<p>Then he placed a shell in the chest
of one brute who was broader and
heavier than the others&mdash;a leader&mdash;and
saw that he had increased the demoralization;
and from the hastily-formed
front rank a volley leaped hot and
jagged.</p>
<p>Then the rout which had threatened
broke loose. As eight ape-men slumped
into blubbering, bleeding heaps, the
milling remainder of the horde turned,
and in a fighting, scrambling frenzy
attempted to get back to the corridor.</p>
<p>Kirby let his triumph take the form
of thoughts about what he would do
to the Duca when that personage could
be rounded up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow after them!&rdquo; he ordered.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop until we have located the
Duca. He is the one we must settle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p>But he never finished.</p>
<p>As he himself, holding fire for
a second, prepared to follow up the retreat,
he found himself confronted by
the utterly unexpected.</p>
<p>A voice unquestionably the Duca&rsquo;s
began to shout orders at the ape-men
from somewhere down the corridor!
And, riot or no riot, the tones of that
voice seemed to inspire the creatures
with more fear than the rifle fire.</p>
<p>So suddenly the change came, that
by the time Kirby flung his rifle again
to his shoulder, the crazy retreat had
been halted, and as he fired again, the
ape-men swung in their tracks and began
to charge!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404' name='page_404'></a>404</span></div>
<p>There was no time to guess by what
power the Duca had turned the tables.
There was not even time for orders.
Kirby fired twice, knowing that the
ape-men had been infused with some
spirit which would bring them on in
spite of rifle fire.</p>
<p>Naida, unarmed, cried out behind
him, and he shoved his gun at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had just inserted a new clip. He
handed her others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire for your lives!&rdquo; he shouted to
the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you!&rdquo; Naida gasped. &ldquo;You are
unarmed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the floor lay a jagged, hand-chipped
knife of obsidion which had
fallen as some ape died. Kirby
grabbed it.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>In</span> another second the flood of ape-men
had burst in all its fury over
him. Crashing, thundering shots were
dinning in his ears, animal death
screams and the Valkyrie battle cries
of the girls filled the temple. He could
not tell how many of the apes were
fighting him. As a cave-man&rsquo;s club
whizzed past his head, he drove his
knife once, and yanked it dripping
from hairy, yielding flesh to plunge it
again. A sudden side-step carried him
away from another assailant. He
dropped the knife to snatch the gigantic
club of one of the creatures he had
killed.</p>
<p>Quicker in every movement than the
ape-men, he laid on, right and left,
with such power that blood spurted in
a dozen places, and heads were split
open on every side. And because of
his speed, the frantic, clumsy blows
and knife thrusts which were directed
at him proved harmless.</p>
<p>A terrific drive which smashed a
snarling face into pulp, left Kirby free
for a second, and he emerged from the
first round of battle ready to cut in
and help the girls. But then he saw
that he had gotten separated from the
main body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naida!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Naida!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A series of shots answered him, and
as several apes fell, a gap was opened
through which he saw her conducting
a well ordered retreat of all the girls
toward the dark corridors surrounding
the temple. Again Kirby fell to with
his club, swinging, hacking, fighting
with his whole strength to catch up.
He made headway, and hope began to
come again. The ape-men would not
kill, or even harm, the girls. What
they wanted was to carry them off. If
he and Naida together could get their
party rounded up in the corridors, the
chances were good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naida!&rdquo; he shouted again. &ldquo;Coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Battering down an ape in front of
him, he jumped up on the corpse, and
saw that already the vanguard of girls
had reached the first sheltering corridor.
Naida had been cut off from the
others by eight or ten apes. But even
so her fire made her mistress of the situation,
and she seemed all right.</p>
<p>It was just as Kirby started to jump
down from the corpse that he saw
something which put another complexion
on the matter, and left him
frozen where he was.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Behind</span> Naida, directly in the
path in which her slavering aggressors
were slowly forcing her, a
huge stone slab in the temple floor had
begun to tilt up as if it were a trapdoor
raised by an invisible hand.
Within the yawning opening, Kirby
caught a glimpse of stone steps winding
down into blackness.</p>
<p>In a flash he saw that it was Naida,
and her alone, that the ape-men were
after. The Duca&rsquo;s determination was
to capture her, and it was the presence
of this trapdoor, making capture possible,
which had brought on the second
charge of the apes.</p>
<p>A scream, high and wild, from Naida
released Kirby from his trance of horror.
He leaped off the corpse, and
smashed a suddenly presented skull
like an egg shell. Momentarily he saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_405' name='page_405'></a>405</span>
Naida, too terrified to fire, staring at
the open trapdoor. Kirby felled two
apes and felt their blood on his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ivana!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Help Naida,
for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An answering shout, not from Ivana
alone but from many girls, encouraged
him, and he swung his club with a
speed and force which would let nothing
stand before him. But then another
scream from Naida rang in his
ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naida!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right!
We&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew, though, that it <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> all
right. Fighting like a maniac, he
opened another lane down which he
glimpsed her. Fighting still, in a last
terrific effort to force his way down
the lane to her side, he saw the black
opening gape at her feet; and, as Naida
screamed again, a dozen hairy arms
reached it at once, twisted the empty
rifle out of her hands, and lifted her
shining body as if it had been a
feather.</p>
<p>Shouts and murderous fire were coming
from the other girls, and Kirby
swung his club as never before. But
even as he fell upon the last two or
three apes which kept him away from
Naida, those who had snatched her,
bolted down the steps.</p>
<p>Kirby was left with the memory of
Naida&rsquo;s great eyes fixed upon his, fear-filled,
beseeching his protection. In a
second, the ponderous trapdoor crashed
into place, and she was gone.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Dazed</span> and grief-stricken, Kirby
stood in the bloody, corpse-filled
nave of the temple, surrounded by
thirty-two girls whose faces were
blanched and most of whose eyes were
tear-bright. The fight was over, and
they were assembled to decide what
must be done, but for a time no one
spoke.</p>
<p>Gaining the trapdoor just as it was
pinioned from beneath, Kirby had torn
at it with bare hands. But that had
been hopeless. Then he had begun to
fight again. But that had been hopeless
also. With howls and screams they
started to retreat, and it had not taken
Kirby long to find out that every part
of their raid had been carefully
planned, even to this retreat under fire.
Straight into the damp black tunnel
which led away from the corridor behind
the altar, the ape-men had leaped.
And Kirby, in hot pursuit, had heard
the Duca&rsquo;s voice driving them on. Too
much the soldier to follow in that
darkness where the Duca knew every
foot of the way, and he knew nothing,
Kirby had seen that he must go back
to the girls and take stock.</p>
<p>Now he looked at the strewn ape
corpses, smelled the corrosive reek of
burned powder, and tried to put aside
his grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duca,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;must
have been planning this with the apes
ever since the first morning in the
castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ivana, Naida&rsquo;s sister, nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duca brought the ape-people
here, kept them in the tunnel, and then
herded them back when their work was
done. I suppose it was one of the
caciques who opened the door when the
time was right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does anyone think we ought to try
the tunnels now?&rdquo; Kirby asked.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Several</span> girls shook their heads.
He knew that already they felt he
had been wise in giving up the pursuit.
Ivana spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Duca and his horde stay underground,
we shouldn&rsquo;t have a chance
against them. And if they don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;re
better here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby shot a searching glance at her,
somehow sure that her thoughts were
running parallel with his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going to
stay here, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and you don&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; Ivana answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that they will retreat
into the Rorroh as fast as they can,&rdquo;
Kirby then observed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_406' name='page_406'></a>406</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think the Duca and all
the caciques will go with the apes?&rdquo;
This time it was Nini who spoke, and
with the council so well launched,
Kirby began to feel better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he answered Nini, &ldquo;that
the Duca has gone over to Xlotli altogether.
We fooled him to-day. Instead
of killing or capturing us all, he&mdash;he
only got Naida. But he won&rsquo;t give
up. I think he is taking the apes off
to some place from which he can launch
a new attack. And we&rsquo;ve got to stop
him before he is ready to deliver another
blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Ivana now
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where the villages of
the ape-people are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. None of us has been very far
into the Rorroh, but I could guess
where some of the villages may stand.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Silence</span> fell after that, but Kirby
knew from the glint in Ivana&rsquo;s
eyes, and the quick breaths which other
girls drew, that they understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ivana,&rdquo; he said suddenly, &ldquo;will you
go with me into the Rorroh jungle, and
stay with me, facing down every
danger it may conceal, until we have
found Naida and brought her back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flush of life crept into Ivana&rsquo;s
pallid cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby faced the other girls, all of
them keyed up now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nini, will you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nini, bronze-haired, dainty nymph of
a girl, who had yet the stamina of a
man, looked at him with brave eyes.
Then her hands tightened on her rifle,
and she stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you have us start?&rdquo; Ivana
asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Kirby answered, and, taking
up the rifle which lay beside him&mdash;the
same with which Naida had fought&mdash;he
looked at the other girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not one of you,&rdquo; he said
slowly, &ldquo;who would not go willingly
on this quest. But the pursuit party
must be small and mobile. And there
is another duty. To all of you I leave
the care of the castle and the plateau.
Take the three rifles I shall leave behind,
do what you can to reassure the
old people, and hold the plateau safe
until we return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur of girls&rsquo; voices sounded in
the temple. Kirby motioned to Nini
and Ivana, and followed by a low
cheer, they moved off together.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> night was on them, where
they crouched in a cave above a
swiftly flowing river. Kirby, rifle
across his knees, sat peering out across
the black, invisible stretches of the
forest. His nostrils quivered to this
mingled smells of fresh growth and
fetid decay of the grotesque land. In
his ears shrilled the creaking and
scraping of insects, the flap of unseen
wings, the distant bellowing grunt of
some unseen, unknown animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot sleep,&rdquo; Ivana said presently,
from back in the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;you will
wake Nini.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am already awake!&rdquo; came her
answer. &ldquo;I&mdash;I cannot forget the white
snakes which slid from that tree when
you tried to cut firewood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; Kirby murmured again.
&ldquo;Presently the moon will rise on the
earth above, and light will come here.
Even if the jungle is terrible, were you
not born with courage? Go to sleep
now, both of you, because you must
relieve me soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As silence fell again, he knew that
the real thing behind their nervousness
was their ghastly doubt about what the
night was bringing to Naida. But none
of them spoke of Naida. So sickening
were the possibilities that Kirby would
not permit conjecture to occupy even
his mind when, at length, the sound of
even breathing told him that Nini and
Ivana slept.</p>
<p>After dreary passing of an hour, a
faint light grew over the jungle, silver
and clear, and Kirby let his mind run
back to the two deserted ape-men communities
which they had found and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_407' name='page_407'></a>407</span>
searched before dusk sent them to the
cave. From the signs of hasty departure,
it looked as though a far-reaching
order had taken the brutes
away from their dwellings, and sent
them&mdash;somewhere.</p>
<p>That somewhere seemed likely to be
the great central community which
Ivana said was rumored to exist in the
far reaches of the Rorroh. The problem
was how to locate the community
through the hideous country. But
Kirby presently drove the question
from his head. To-morrow&rsquo;s evils could
best be faced when morrow dawned.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Enough</span> light had grown now so
that the swirling bosom of the
river, and a strip of sand directly below
the cliff in which their cave was
set, were visible. As Kirby let his eyes
wander to the lush growth beyond the
sand, he heard something which made
him stir uneasily. Some creature which
suggested power and hugeness immeasurable
was moving there.</p>
<p>The brush parted, and he saw plainly
an animal with the bulk of a two-story
house. On two feet the nightmare thing
stood, as lightly as a cat, and then came
down on all four feet as it ambled out
on the sand and extended into the lapping
river a tremendous beak studded
with teeth. A smell of crushed weeds
and the musty odor like that of a lion
house filled the night. The tyranosaur&mdash;it
was more like a tyranosaur than
anything else&mdash;breathed heavily and
guzzled in great mouthfuls of water.</p>
<p>Kirby sat perfectly still. He hoped
the thing would go away. But the
tyranosaur did not go away. All at
once it hissed loudly and stood up, its
eyes glowing green and baleful, and
Kirby leaned forward.</p>
<p>From the water was slithering another
creature with a gigantic, quivering,
jelly body. Kirby saw to his horror
that, in addition to four short legs
with webbed, claw-tipped feet, there
sprouted from the body a number of
octopus tentacles. From the scabrous
mottle of the head, cruel, unintelligent,
bestial eyes glared at the rearing
tyranosaur.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>One</span> of the serpentine tentacles
whipped out, slapped against the
tyranosaur&rsquo;s fore-shoulder to call forth
a hiss and a short bellow. Then other
tentacles waved in the moonlight, and
in a flash the tyranosaur was enmeshed
as by a score of slimy cables. He was
not altogether helpless. Suddenly the
steam shovel of a beak buried itself in
the jelly body of the water animal, and
there spurted out a flood of inky liquid.
The water animal emitted a sickening
gurgle. But the tyranosaur&rsquo;s advantage
was only temporary. Closer and closer
drew the ugly, scabrous tentacles. The
tyranosaur never had a chance. Its
green eyes flared, the shovel beak
plunged and slashed, but never for a
second did the tentacles relax. As
Kirby stared, he saw the water animal
begin to back up, dragging its gigantic
enemy with it. For a second the whole
night was hideous with the sound of
hisses, gurgles, dashing water. Then
the river boiled once and for all, and
both animals sank in its depths.</p>
<p>Kirby chafed cold hands together and
shivered a little, then turned to see if
Nini and Ivana had heard the struggle.</p>
<p>Fortunately, however, they still slept.
And as if this peace which was upon
them were an omen of good, the jungle
continued quiet for the next hour.
Kirby wakened them at last, and after
a snatched nap, was in turn awakened.</p>
<p>The three of them started again when
the first glimmerings of dawn came to
the forest. Of food there was plenty&mdash;fruits
which grew in profusion, and
some roots which Nini grubbed out of
the earth. Having started along the
first trail which they encountered beside
the river bank, they ate as they
walked.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Kirby</span> judged they had kept their
steady gait for more than two
hours before a slight widening of the
trail roused him from the preoccupation
into which he had fallen.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_408' name='page_408'></a>408</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;See there,&rdquo; he exclaimed to both
girls, and pointed at a grove of trees
with fanlike leaves which towered up
to the right of the trail. &ldquo;What are
those big bundles fastened to the lower
limbs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ivana glanced at Nini, who nodded as
if in answer to a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be one of the places
where the ape-people leave their dead,&rdquo;
Nini answered. &ldquo;The bundles&mdash;But
come over to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby forced his way ahead until he
stood beneath a huge, unsavory bundle
wrapped in roughly woven brown fibre,
and wedged in a fork between two
limbs. Judging from the ugly odor
which overhung the grove, there could
be no question about what the bundle
contained. Nini and Ivana, glancing at
the scores of similar bundles which
burdened the trees of the whole grove,
made wry faces. Kirby slung his rifle
in the crook of his arm, and nodded
toward the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be a village somewhere
near,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>A mile farther on they found what
they were seeking, a colony of seventy
or eighty conical dwellings of mud and
thatch, which were ranged in a double
circle about a central common of bare,
well-trodden earth. It took no long
reconnaissance to discover that the
town was deserted completely of all
inhabitants.</p>
<p>Ivana beckoned and darted to one of
the nearest huts, and Kirby, following
her, found lying on the uneven earth
floor within, a half-skinned animal
which resembled a small antelope. An
obsidion knife beside the carcass, the
disordered condition of a couch of
grass, the sour odor of recent animal
occupancy, all told their story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The owner left in a hurry,&rdquo; Kirby
observed aloud.</p>
<p>Nini, who had gone beyond, to a
larger hut which might have belonged
to a king ape, called out excitedly to
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great number of apes have eaten
a hurried meal here!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Kirby</span> entered the shadowed, foul-smelling
interior of the central
hut to find her statement true. Broken
meats, some raw, some cooked, lay on
the dirt floor, and scattered bits of fruit
were mingled with them. The ashes of
a burned out fire at the hut entrance
were cold, but had not been for long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think&mdash;&rdquo; Ivana began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the whole of the Duca&rsquo;s
horde came this way, fed, and went on,
taking everyone with them,&rdquo; Kirby
finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But which direction did they take?&rdquo;
asked Nini, who was standing at the
door of the big hut and had already begun
to examine the crowding, green,
inscrutable walls of jungle which
foamed up to the clearing on all sides.</p>
<p>No less than seven trails wound away
into the dark country beyond, and
Kirby saw that the question would not
be an easy one.</p>
<p>Having hastily circled the clearing
and peered down one trail after another
without finding a clue, he knew that it
was the Duca&rsquo;s intelligence which had
made the ape-people depart without
leaving even tracks behind them. He
did not like the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he rumbled to his companions,
&ldquo;we may as well take our
choice. One chance in seven of coming
out right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the words were hardly out of his
mouth before he pulled himself up
with a jerk, and cursed himself for having
given in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ivana! Nini!&rdquo; Sharpness, a sudden
ring of hope edged his voice. &ldquo;Am
I seeing things, or is that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>As</span> he pointed to a huge aloe bush
down one of the trails to their
left, they started to run. Then Kirby
knew that he was not seeing things.
What his first inspection of the trails
had failed to show, he saw plainly
now.</p>
<p>Tied loosely to one branch of the aloe
bush, almost concealed amidst the deep
green of foliage, was a bit of white
cloth! In a second Kirby was holding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_409' name='page_409'></a>409</span>
out to his companions a tiny strip of
Naida&rsquo;s wedding gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knew we would come!&rdquo; He
stared down the trail with narrowed,
keen eyes.</p>
<p>How Naida had contrived to leave
her signal was more than they knew.
The fact that she <i>had</i> done so, sent
all three of them down the trail at driving
speed.</p>
<p>An hour passed, then another, and
the morning which had been barely
born when they first took the trail,
wore on to the sultriness and vast,
colored light of a tropical noon. Twice
the main trail forked, and twice they
found an unobtrusive bit of cloth to
guide them beyond the works. When
the hands of Kirby&rsquo;s still useful watch
pointed to twelve, they paused to eat
and rest. Then they pushed on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the country through
which they passed left Kirby with a
clear understanding of why Naida and
her people had shunned the Rorroh
forest down the centuries of time.</p>
<p>Just one thing which stuck in his
head was the sight of a small creature
like a marmoset, sticking an inquisitive
nose into the heart of a sickly-sweet
plant which resembled a terrestrial
nepenthe. No sooner had the little pink
snout touched the green and maroon
splotched petals, than the plant
writhed, closed its leaves, and swallowed
the monkey whole. Little
squeaks of agony and terror sounded
for a moment, and ceased.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>At</span> midafternoon they paused in a
spot where a forest of trees with
whorled tops were slowly being
strangled to death by immense orchids
of every conceivable shape and color,
and by a kind of creeping mistletoe
which grew almost as they watched.
Here also, the ground was covered with
fluffy, grey-green moss which seethed
constantly as if it were a carpet of
maggots. Both Ivana and Nini warned
Kirby on his life not to touch or go
near the moss, and a moment later he
knew why.</p>
<p>From the forest came the flash of a
small, five-toed horse being pursued by
some animal with a hyena head that
barked. At the edge of the mossy
glade the hyena swerved aside, but the
terrified horse plunged straight out on
the carpet of moss. Instantly the air
was filled with the sound of animal
screams, and a series of tiny, muffled
explosions. A cloud of greenish-red
mist swirled about the horse. Quivering,
still screaming, the animal went
down on its knees, and as the reddish
green smoke fell on him and settled,
it became a mass of growing moss
spores.</p>
<p>Before Kirby&rsquo;s eyes, the pitiful animal
was covered by a shroud of green
that spread over him and cloaked him,
licking over all with tiny sounds like
far off muffled drums as fresh spore
cases developed and burst. The screams
died. Even as Kirby drew the girls to
him and they passed on, the horse&rsquo;s
nostrils, eyes, mouth were filled with
choking green moss; and he lay still.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>On</span> and on, deeper into the jungle
Kirby pushed, and never for a
moment did his companions falter. But
the way was not so easy now, for nerves
were jaded, muscles sore, and no human
will could have been powerful
enough to cast aside the growing fear
for Naida.</p>
<p>Fear came finally to a head when, toward
dusk, Kirby sighted a fork ahead
of them, approached it confidently to
look for Naida&rsquo;s sign, and found
nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Lord!&rdquo; he muttered, and realized
that it was the first time any of them
had spoken for long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be something to guide
us!&rdquo; Ivana exclaimed as she searched
with questing eyes through the swiftly
deepening gloom of evening.</p>
<p>Nini, making an effort to keep up
hope in spite of the paleness which
came to her lovely face, darted down
both paths, glancing as she went at
every bush and shrub. But she returned
in a moment, and as she shook
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_410' name='page_410'></a>410</span>
her head, her great eyes were somber.</p>
<p>Kirby grunted, scratched behind his
ear. Then, however, he stifled an exclamation,
and clutched at the hands of
both girls.</p>
<p>On one of the two trails appeared
suddenly in the dusk an ape-creature.
Kirby saw at once that the thing was
small&mdash;a female undoubtedly&mdash;and that
it had spied them and was moving toward
them with all speed. And borne
in upon him most certainly was the
fact that the ape-woman was making
signals of peace. In her outstretched
hand flickered through the gloom a
strip of cloth that was gauzy and white.</p>
<p>Again&mdash;a strip of Naida&rsquo;s gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you know any words of her
tongue, call to her,&rdquo; Kirby said sharply.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Ivana</span> obeyed. All three of them
started forward. The ape-woman,
after returning the hail in creaking
gutturals, came up to them, and with an
unexpected look of pathos and entreaty
in her face, began to address the girls
with a flood of talk.</p>
<p>Word after creaking word she poured
out while Nini and Ivana listened in
silence. Finally Kirby could stand the
suspense no longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Ivana? What does she
say? Your eyes are lighting up with
hope! Tell me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ivana smiled and turned toward him,
while the ape-woman still looked her
entreaty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says,&rdquo; Ivana announced bluntly,
&ldquo;that she and the other women amongst
their people, do not want any of the
girls of our race to be taken by their
males. Already the men are quarreling
about Naida. They will not look at
their own women. Naida told this
woman that we would be following,
and sent her to lead us to the place
where the ape-people are assembling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby felt his lips tightening in a
grim smile at the thought that jealousy
was not unknown even to the semi-human
creatures of this neither world.
He looked at Nini and Ivana during a
stretched out second. Then he moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;We go on at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was his only recognition of
what was surely one of the important
happenings of a lifetime. But for all
that, his tired brain, which so lately
had felt the chill of black depression,
was suddenly set on fire with triumph
and thanksgiving.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>As</span> they marched rapidly, the ape-woman,
who called herself Gori,
succeeded in making them understand
that most of the ape-tribes, commanded
by the Duca and his caciques, were assembled
in the central community toward
which they were heading, that
grave danger of some sort threatened
Naida, and that the need for haste was
great. But what the danger was, the
two girls could not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t make out what is going
to happen&mdash;what they plan to do to-night,&rdquo;
Ivana whispered at last to
Kirby. &ldquo;All Gori says is that we must
rescue Naida and take her away, and
must take the Duca away so that he
cannot influence the men any more.
And she keeps repeating that we must
hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t find out what we
must rescue Naida <i>from</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ivana shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re facing something
of an appalling nature, as dangerous to
ourselves as to Naida. But I know
nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time the silver glow which
corresponded to moonlight flooded the
jungle, Gori had left the open trail,
and was leading them across country
which humans could not have negotiated
without the guidance she offered.
Advancing cautiously always, she stopped
for long seconds at a time to
reconnoitre, shifting her huge ears
about and changing their shape, twitching
her nostrils, and glancing hither
and thither with bright little eyes.
Sometimes they passed immense spike-tipped
flowers ten feet in diameter,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_411' name='page_411'></a>411</span>
with fleshy yellow leaves which gave
out a nauseating stench. Vines with
long, recurved thorns and blossoms of
deep scarlet, laced the undergrowth together
and made passing dangerous.
Fire-flies drifted past, and all above and
about them flapped moths as big as
bats.</p>
<p>Kirby, his clothes almost torn from
his body, sweat pouring from every
pore, heard the labored breathing of
the girls, and wondered how they could
hang on. But they did, and after a
long time, Gori, halting in the midst
of a slight clearing, held up a warning
hand.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>A queer</span> sensation came over
Kirby. As he stared and listened,
he realized that the twinkles he saw
far ahead were not fire-flies, as he
had thought, but lights. In the frosted
moon glow, Nini and Ivana drew close,
and Kirby clasped their hands and
pressed them for a second. Too tired
to exult further he was, even though
they seemed close to their goal of
goals.</p>
<p>Gori swung her hairy arm in a
signal, and with rifles clasped carefully,
they began to advance. When, five
minutes later, they stood in the heart
of a rank glade beyond which they
could see nothing, Gori spoke to the
two girls in her creaking whisper, and
Nini laid a restraining hand on Kirby&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have gone as far as Gori dares!
She says we must climb a tree here,
and watch what will go on in a clearing
just beyond this thicket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we still don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re
getting into,&rdquo; Kirby muttered.</p>
<p>But at any rate they had reached the
end of their march.</p>
<p>Exultation did come to Kirby now,
but still he was too completely fagged,
as were both girls, to give much sign.
Gori pointed to a tree some fifty feet
away, which shot up to a great, foliage-crowned
height. They moved toward
it, and in a moment were climbing,
Gori first, the girls after her, and Kirby
last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; Ivana presently whispered,
at the same time drawing herself
out on a limb just beneath one on
which Gori and Nini had crawled.</p>
<p>Kirby found himself hedged in by
tasselated leaves through which he
could not see. The foliage thinned,
however, and soon Ivana halted,
perched herself in a comfortable position.
Kirby, making himself at ease
beside her, and seeing that Nini and
Gori were in place, turned his eyes
slowly, expectantly downward.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>At</span> first, all that he saw from his
bird&rsquo;s-eye perch, was a circular
clearing two hundred yards across,
which was surrounded on all sides by
lowering jungle. In the exact center
of the circle, like a splotch of ink on
gray paper, there gaped a deep hole
which might have measured six feet
in diameter. Around this hole, eight
poles as tall and stout as telephone
poles stood up in bristling array. The
moonlight showed that the whitish
earth of the clearing was tamped
smooth as though thousands of creatures
had danced or walked about there
for centuries. But not a living form
was visible.</p>
<p>A grunt of disappointment escaped
Kirby after that one look. When he
looked beyond the clearing, however,
a change came to his feelings.</p>
<p>A quarter of a mile away, lights were
twinkling&mdash;the same ones which had
been visible on the last stretch of the
journey. And the moonlight touched
the little conical roofs of fully two
hundred huts of the ape-people. No
sound was audible save the soughing
of night wind in the trees, the shrilling
of insects. Nevertheless, there stole
over Kirby all at once a feeling that
the great ape-village was crowded to
overflowing. What was more, he felt
himself touched by an eery sensation&mdash;familiar
these days&mdash;of evil to come.</p>
<p>Ivana, seated with her rifle across her
knees, stirred on the limb beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she whispered suddenly, &ldquo;I
am afraid of this place!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_412' name='page_412'></a>412</span></div>
<p>Kirby took her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. Maybe it is the sensation
of all the legions of the apes herded
together so silently in their village. I
wish we knew what to expect from
them. I wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>But</span> he broke off, and called softly
to Nini on the limb above. She
looked down with a drawn expression
about her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; Kirby whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But&mdash;Well, are both of <i>you</i>
all right? Gori says we have reached
here in time, but I&mdash;&rdquo; A gasp of uneasiness
escaped her, and Kirby heard
Ivana echo it. &ldquo;There is something
about that black, silent hole out there
in the clearing, and about those poles
sticking up like fangs, that makes me
terribly, terribly afraid. Oh, what are
they planning? Where is Naida?
What are they going to do to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby whistled in a low key. He
had not thought about the black hole
in the clearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s interesting.
Ivana, Nini, what do you suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he got no answer. Gori&rsquo;s twitching
lips grimaced them to silence.</p>
<p>The next instant, the stillness of the
night was hurled aside by a howling,
gurgling shout from a hundred, a thousand
hysterically distended ape throats.
With the sickening sound came from
the village the sullen roaring of drums.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Ten</span> minutes later, a Kirby who
was cold with apprehension and
wonder looked down from his leaf-crowned
height at such a spectacle as
he knew human eyes had never before
seen. The shouting had died away, the
drums were silenced. Crammed into
the clearing, their foul, hairy bodies
packed close together, the silver light
glinting against rolling red eyes and
grinning white teeth, stood fully a
thousand apes!</p>
<p>Once the first tumult of shouting in
the village had died, they had come on
in silence, and in orderly procession.
Those who bore the drums&mdash;huge
gourds with heads of stretched skin&mdash;had
formed a line entirely around the
outer diameter of the circular clearing.
Then others, lugging vats of a dark,
heady-smelling liquor, had deposited
their burden beside the drums, and
formed a second circle. The balance
of the thousand had crowded itself together
as best it might, leaving bare
the center of the clearing with its
black hole and fangs of poles. Kirby,
looking down at these legions, did not wonder
that cold sweat wetted his back.</p>
<p>Capable of thinking about only one
thing&mdash;Naida&mdash;he was trying with all
his strength not to think. Ivana, her
face blanched in the light which filtered
their camouflage of leaves, sat
rigid, her hands locked about her cold
rifle. On the branch above, Nini and
Gori were as still as mummies. No one
had spoken since the vanguard of apes
had appeared.</p>
<p>But at last Nini leaned close to
Kirby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea of what all this
means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A draught of hot night air carried
up a stench of drunkenness, and the
goaty odor of massed animal bodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Kirby whispered. &ldquo;I suppose,
from Gori&rsquo;s having brought us here,
that Naida is going to appear somehow.
We&rsquo;ve simply got to trust that
Gori knows what she is about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But listen&mdash;&rdquo; Ivana suppressed a
shudder. &ldquo;Suppose they should bring
Naida here presently to force her to
take part in some ceremony at which
we can only guess. Gori, who thinks
we can work miracles, supposes we can
rescue Naida. But I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not so certain.
Is there <i>anything</i> we can do?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>It</span> was exactly that question which
had made Kirby fight to keep himself
from thinking. His face turned
gray before he answered. But answer
he did, finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is one thing we can do,
Ivana. We&rsquo;ve got to be frank with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_413' name='page_413'></a>413</span>
each other, and so far, this is the <i>only</i>
thing I&rsquo;ve been able to figure out. If
Naida is brought here, and they make
any move to harm her or torture her,
we can, and we will, shoot her quickly,
before harm or pain comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A grim silence settled once more.
During the last miles of march in the
jungle, there had persisted in Kirby&rsquo;s
heart the hope that there would be at
least <i>something</i> favorable in whatever
situation they might encounter. His
spirits were so low now that he dared
not speak again.</p>
<p>Amongst the noiseless sea of ape-men
below them came, every now and
again, a little ripple of motion as some
anthropoid shadow fell out of his place,
approached the liquor vats, and swilled
down the black brew, a quart at a gulp.
But mostly there was little commotion.
Ivana drew a sibilant breath and
said that she wished something would
happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; Kirby answered tensely,
&ldquo;that we knew <i>what</i> is going to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the nightmare waiting was not
to go on forever. Kirby leaned forward
and pointed.</p>
<p>It was only instinct that had made
him know action must come. For a second,
no change in the expression of
the ape-men, no movement in their
crammed ranks, was visible. Then,
however, a queer, subdued grunting
rumbled deep down in many throats,
and those who had faced the hundred-foot
space in the center of the clearing
squatted down on their hams.</p>
<p>In the back of the crowd necks were
craned. The stronger shoved the
weaker in an effort to get a better view
of the cleared stage, and a few ape-men
who had been drinking hurried
on unsteady legs to their places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The drums!&rdquo; Kirby whispered then.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>With</span> almost military precision,
the scores of leather-faced creatures
who had led the procession into
the clearing, clasped the skin-headed
gourds to their shaggy bellies, and
stood with free arm raised as though
awaiting a signal. Nini moved in her
position, and Kirby felt Ivana shiver
and edge close to him.</p>
<p>From the front rank of the crowd,
there sprang up a great male creature
with the face of a gargoyle and the
body of a jungle giant. Just once he
reeled on his feet, as though black alcohol
had befuddled him, then he steadied
himself, flung both arms above his
head, and rolled out a command which
burst upon Kirby&rsquo;s ears like thunder.</p>
<p>It was as if the whole cavern of the
lower world, and the whole of the
round earth itself, had been rocked
uneasily, dreadfully by the bellowing,
crashing explosion of the drums. Maddened
by the turmoil he had let loose,
the gargoyle-faced giant ape-man
leered about him with blood-shot,
drunken eyes, and beat on his cicatrized
chest with massive fists. Suddenly
he let out a bellow. Straight
up into the air he sprang in a wild
leap. When he came down, he was
dancing, and the portentious, the sickeningly
mysterious ceremony for which
such solemn preparation had been
made, was begun.</p>
<p>Kirby drew a rasping breath. Knowing
that there must be some definite
reason for the dance having begun just
when and as it had, he looked beyond
the solitary dancing giant, on beyond
the crowded legions of the apes, toward
the village. There, where the
main trail from the community approached
the clearing, he saw precisely
the thing which he had both hoped
desperately and dreaded terribly to
find.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Headed</span> directly toward the
clearing, moving down the trail
with slow, majestic pace, came a procession
headed by a bodyguard of ape-men
and augmented by other men
whose nakedness was covered by unmistakable,
unforgetable priestly robes
of gray.</p>
<p>All at once the ape-people in the
clearing began to scuffle apart, opening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_414' name='page_414'></a>414</span>
a lane down which the procession
might pass to the central stage with
its dancer, its ink spot orifice, and its
fangs of tall poles. Kirby, watching
the congregation, watching the majestic
approach of gray robes through the
night, wiped away from his forehead
a sweat of fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; Nini called in a voice
pitched high to outsound the drums,
&ldquo;that the&mdash;the Duca is with them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Kirby pointed jerkily. &ldquo;In
the middle of the procession, there,
surrounded by his caciques!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duca!</p>
<p>Yet his approach did not hold Kirby.
Directly behind the priests were
emerging now from the jungle a new
company of ape-men. Squinting his
eyes, Kirby saw that two of them were
lugging on a pole across their shoulders
a curious burden&mdash;a sort of monstrous
bird cage of barked withes.
Crouched on the floor of the cage in a
little motionless, white heap&mdash;</p>
<p>But Kirby closed his eyes. Ivana,
cowering against him, gulped as
though she were going to be sick. Nini
leaned down from above and looked
at them with dilated eyes. Although
none of them spoke, all knew that they
had found Naida at last.</p>
<p>Kirby was the first to pull himself
up. Opening his eyes, he stared long
at the white gowned, motionless shape
within the cage. Next summing up
the whole situation&mdash;the cage surrounded
by an armed band, the clearing
crammed with a thousand ape-men&mdash;he
shook his head. Afterward, he
made a quick movement with his hands.</p>
<p>Ivana, seeing that movement, seeing
the expression on his face, started out
of her daze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Oh, there must be some
other way out for her! There must&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Her</span> cry, half a shriek, did not
change Kirby&rsquo;s look. What he
had done with his hands was to throw
a shell into the chamber of his rifle.
Now he held the rifle grimly, ready to
carry it to his shoulder.</p>
<p>The procession with the bodyguard
of ape-men at its head, the renegade
Duca and his caciques following next,
and the cage bringing up the rear, advanced
relentlessly down the lane to
the central stage. The gargoyle-faced
ape-man who held the stage alone
danced with increasing wildness,
writhing, twisting, with weird suppleness.
Upon the dancing giant the procession
bore down, and before him it
finally halted.</p>
<p>The halt left the Duca and the king
ape facing each other, and the ape
ended his dance. After each had given
a salute made by raising their arms,
both Duca and the king ape turned to
face the creatures who were standing
with the cage slung across their shoulders.
Whereupon the bearers of the
cage advanced with it until they stood
between two of the tall poles. There,
facing the ominous hole in the center
of the clearing, with a pole on either
side of them, the ape-men lowered the
cage to the ground.</p>
<p>Kirby felt his last hope and courage
ebbing. Now he noticed that each pole
was equipped with a rope which passed
through a hole near its top, like a
thread through the eye of a needle.
And while he stared at the dangling
ropes, the ape-men made one end of
each fast to a ring in the top of the
cage. The next instant they leaped
back, and began to heave at the other
end of the lines.</p>
<p>From the drums came a quicker
pounding, a more head-splitting volume
of thunder. Over all the ape-people
who watched the show, passed
a shiver of what seemed to be whole-souled,
ecstatic satisfaction. Slowly,
as the two ape-men heaved hard, the
cage swung off the ground, and slowly
rose higher and higher into the moonlit
air.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>When</span> finally the thing hung
high above the heads of the
multitude, swaying midway between
its tall supports, the ape-men who had
done the hoisting fastened their lines
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_415' name='page_415'></a>415</span>
to cleats on the poles. Then they
turned to the Duca and the giant king
who stood behind them, executed a
queer, lumbering bow, and fell back to
the rear.</p>
<p>The next moment it seemed as
though every creature in the clearing&mdash;men
and those who were only half
men&mdash;had gone crazy. The king flung
himself into the air as if he were a
mass of bounding rubber. Following
his lead, the whole assembly let out
howls that drowned even the drums,
and then began to sway, to squirm, to
leap, even as their king was doing before
them.</p>
<p>The caciques and the Duca joined
in the madness of foul dancing as
heartily as any there. Their eyes were
flaming, their long robes flapping, their
beards streaming.</p>
<p>On his perch in the tree Kirby muttered
an oath which was lost, swept
away like a breath, in the shrieking
turmoil of sound. Then he turned to
Ivana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve brought Naida here to sacrifice
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>why</i>?&rdquo; Ivana&rsquo;s sweet face was
frozen in lines of horror. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
able to guess what was going to happen
to her. But&mdash;<i>sacrifice</i>. Why will it
be that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; Looking up to include
Nini, Kirby found his hands
quivering against his rifle. &ldquo;It is easy
to understand. In the temple yesterday,
what the Duca hoped to do was
to kidnap most, or all, of the girls for
the ape-people. But he was able to get
only Naida. The first result was that
the ape-men started to quarrel over the
one girl. From what Gori says, trouble
started on all sides at once. It became
inadvisable to let Naida live. So the
Duca, in his shrewdness, planned a sacrifice.
By sacrificing Naida, he rids
himself of a source of contention
amongst the ape-men. He also hopes
his act will win favor from his Gods,
and make them help him when he is
ready to launch a new attempt to capture
<i>all</i> the girls.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Ivana</span> and Nini looked at each
other, then at Kirby, and horror
was etched deeper into their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; gulped Ivana, &ldquo;that you&mdash;are
right. I&mdash;begin to understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nini leaned close to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us, then, <i>how</i> this sacrifice is
to be made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silent at that, Kirby presently made
a heavy gesture toward the maelstrom
of howling, leaping animals below
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t guess at first. Now I
think I can. They have placed her in
that cage and swung it high above the
black hole you were afraid of. What
can that mean except that she is to be
offered to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a monstrous theory which had
stunned his hope and courage, and to
voice the thing in words was too gruesome.</p>
<p>His bare suggestion, however, made
Ivana pass a hand limply over her forehead
and look at him with blank,
stricken eyes. Nini tottered so uncertainly
that Gori, who had remained
motionless and silent throughout, had
to steady her with muscular arms. If
it was impossible for Kirby to utter
his fears aloud, he had no need to speak
to make them understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and we can do nothing?&rdquo;
Nini choked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see for yourself how she
is surrounded. If we had been able to
get here sooner, we might have done
something. Now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby&rsquo;s voice trailed off, and he gave
an agonized look at his rifle.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> terrific dance in the clearing
was going forward with madness
which increased second by second. It
had been a general debauch at first,
with the whole thousand of the apes
bellowing and squirming. Now a
change was becoming apparent. Red
eyes which had caught the glare of
ultimate madness, focused upon the
caciques, the Duca, and the great king,
all of whom were swaying together
on the central stage. As they looked,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_416' name='page_416'></a>416</span>
the horde of ape-men broke loose with
a heightened frenzy of noise and movement
too overwhelming for Kirby to
follow. He leaned forward, making an
effort to see what actions of Duca and
king could be so influencing the congregation.
And then he saw.</p>
<p>Both of those central figures, the
one with hair-covered giant&rsquo;s body and
evilly grimacing face, the other with
white robes and whipping silver hair,
were definitely emulating the motions
of a serpent!</p>
<p>It was as if the angles and joints
had disappeared from their bodies.
They were become gliding lengths of
muscle as swift, as loathsome in their
supple dartings and coilings as any
snake lashing across the expanses of
primeval jungle. Lost in what they
did, unconscious of the nightmare,
demoniac legion before which they
danced, they had eyes only for the
empty, ominous hole beneath Naida&rsquo;s
cage. As they circled the hole, drawing
ever and ever closer to it, they
opened and closed their arms with the
motion of great serpent jaws biting
and striking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God in Heaven!&rdquo; Kirby cried in a
voice which shrilled with horror and
then broke.</p>
<p>It was not alone the Duca&rsquo;s dance
which had wrung the shout from him.
As Nina and Ivana shrieked and cowered,
as Gori twitched, gasped, buried
her head in trembling arms, Kirby
knew that Naida was fully aware of
what was going on&mdash;had been, perhaps,
from the beginning.</p>
<p>Slowly, numbly she raised herself
from her huddled position, rose to her
knees, and clutching with despairing
hands at the sides of her cage, looked
out from between the bars.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>The</span> king and Duca edged closer
to the hole until they were dancing
upon its very brink. From that
position, they stared down into the
depths, their faces tense and strained.
And then their look became radiant,
exalted, joyous. Suddenly the Duca
leaped back. He shrieked something
at the gargoyle ape, and they flung
their arms high in a commanding,
mighty signal which was directed
across the nightmare legion of ape-men,
to the drums.</p>
<p>As Kirby winced in expectancy, the
drums ceased to roar. Over the night
smashed a hideous concussion of silence,
deafening, absolute. And the
ape-men&mdash;all of them&mdash;and the Duca,
his caciques, and the king, ceased to
dance. As if a whirlwind had hurled
them, the caciques scattered in all directions.
The Duca, having already
leaped back from the gaping orifice,
suddenly turned and ran with blurred
speed over to the slobbering, deadly
still front rank of the congregation.
An instant later the king crouched
down beside him, and the whole stage
was left bare and deserted.</p>
<p>Kirby gave one look at Naida, found
her staring down, deeper and deeper
down, into the hole which yawned beneath
her so blackly. Then Kirby lowered
his eyes until he, too, stared at
the opening.</p>
<p>Amidst the pressing silence there
stole from the earth an uneasy sound
as of some immense thing waking and
stirring. Came a hissing note as of
escaping steam. The tribes of the ape-men
waited in silent rapture. Kirby
saw Naida still looking down, and felt
Ivana crouch against him, fainting.
He held his rifle tighter, and continued
to stare.</p>
<p>Something red, like two small flames,
licked up above the edge of the pit.
Then Kirby gasped and all but went
limp. Up and out into the moonlight
slid a glistening white lump that
moved from side to side and licked at
the night with flickering black and red
tipped forked tongue.</p>
<p>The glistening white lump was the
head of Quetzalcoatl, buried God of
the People of the Temple. It was
wider and bigger than an elephant&rsquo;s,
and the round snake body could not
have been encircled by a man&rsquo;s two
arms. Kirby guessed at the probable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_417' name='page_417'></a>417</span>
length of the Serpent in terms of hundreds
of feet.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Sick</span>, numb, he glanced at Naida,
who was still staring silently, and
hitched his rifle half up to his shoulder.
But he did not look down the
sights yet. Although it was time, and
more than time, that he fired, he would
not do it until the last possible second,
when nothing else remained.</p>
<p>Slowly from the hole slid a fifteen
or twenty-foot column of the body,
and Quetzalcoatl, thus reared, looked
about him with a pair of eyes immense
and not like snake&rsquo;s eyes, but heavily
lidded and lashed; eyes that stared in
a wise, evil way; eyes glittering and
round and black as ink. After a time
the mouth opened in a silent snarl,
showing great white fangs and recurved
simitars of teeth. The head was
snow white, leperous in its scabby,
scaly roughness, with here and there
a patch of what looked like greenish
fungus. From the rounded body trailed
a short, unnatural, sickening growth
of&mdash;feathers. Old and evil and very
wise the Feathered Serpent seemed as
his forked tongue flickered in and out
and he stared at the ape horde, who
stared back silently.</p>
<p>He seemed in no hurry to devote his
attention to the cage set forth for his
delectation. The black eyes rolled beneath
their lashes, staring now at the
Duca in his robes, and again at the
huddled ape-people. But after ghastly
seconds, Quetzalcoatl at last had seen
enough.</p>
<p>Again the moonlight glinted against
simitar teeth as the great, white, puffy
mouth yawned in its silent snarl.
Quetzalcoatl reared his head a little
higher, slid further from his hole, and
then looked up at the dangling cage
of barked withes.</p>
<p>In Kirby&rsquo;s mind stirred cloudily a
remembrance of moments in the past:
the feel of Naida&rsquo;s first kiss, her look
as they advanced to the altar in the
temple. Then he saw things as they
were now, with Naida surrounded by
all the tribes of the apes, and with
Quetzalcoatl staring from beneath
heavily lidded lashes at the whiteness
of her.</p>
<p>Suddenly Kirby stirred to free his
shoulder of Ivana&rsquo;s supine weight
against it, and he made himself look
down his rifle. He let the breath half
out of his lungs, and nursed the trigger.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>But</span> he did not fire.</p>
<p>All at once he started so violently
that he almost hurtled from the
tree. Suddenly, trembling, he lowered
his rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank God!&rdquo; he yelped in the
silence of the night.</p>
<p>The idea which had transformed him
was perhaps the conception of a lunatic.
But it was still an idea, and offered
a chance.</p>
<p>Again Kirby peered down his rifle.
But he no longer aimed at Naida. As
Quetzalcoatl lifted white fangs, Kirby
aimed deliberately at him, and turned
loose his fire.</p>
<p>With the first shot, the Serpent
lurched back from the cage, snapped
his jaws, and closed evil, black eyes.
From one lidded socket squirted dark
blood. As a second and third shot
crashed into the cavernous fanged
mouth, and others ripped into the flat
skull, Quetzalcoatl seemed dazed. His
head wavered back and forth and his
hiss filled the night, but he did nothing.</p>
<p>But all at once Kirby felt that he
was <i>going</i> to do something in a second,
and a great calm came upon him.
He quickly jammed home a fresh clip
of shells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nini! Ivana! Fire at the Serpent.
Give him everything you&rsquo;ve got! Do
you understand? Fire! He thinks that
the ape-people have hurt him, and he
will be after them in a second. If we
have any luck, he will do to them what
we never could have done, and maybe
destroy himself at the same time! Me,
I&rsquo;m going down there and get Naida
now!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_418' name='page_418'></a>418</span></div>
<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>No</span> sooner did Kirby see comprehension
in the girls&rsquo; faces than
he swung around and let go of his
perch. As he crashed, caught the next
limb below him, and let go to crash
to another, he had all he could do to
suppress a yelp of joy. For all at once
every voice in the ape congregation
was raised in howls and screams of
devastated terror.</p>
<p>He did not care how he got down
from the tree. Seconds and half seconds
were what counted. From the
last limb above the ground he swung
into space, and a split second later
staggered to his feet, clutched his rifle,
and started for the clearing. His lungs
seemed collapsed and both ankles shattered.
He did not care. Not when the
ape screams were growing louder with
every step he took. Not when he heard
Nini and Ivana pouring down from
their tree a continuation of the scorching
fire he had started.</p>
<p>Panting, his breath only half regained,
but steeled to make the fight
of his life, he tore from the jungle
into the clearing just in time to see a
twisting, pain-convulsed seventy-foot
coil of white muscle lash up and strike
Naida&rsquo;s cage a blow which knocked it
like a ball in the air. Naida screamed
and hung to the bars.</p>
<p>But she was all right. It was not
against her that Quetzalcoatl was venting
his wrath: the blow had been blind
accident. As Kirby stood at the clearing&rsquo;s
edge, he knew to a certainty that
Quetzalcoatl&rsquo;s reaction to sudden pain
had been all he had dared hope.</p>
<p>In front of him forty or fifty ape-bodies
lay in a crushed heap. While
yard after yard of the Serpent&rsquo;s
bleached length streamed out of the
hole, the hundreds of feet of coils already
in the clearing suddenly whipped
about a whole squadron of ape-men,
and with a few constrictions annihilated
them as if they had been ants.
Across the clearing, the leperous head
reared up as high as the trees and
swooped down, fangs gleaming. The
howls of the ape-men trying to flee,
the screams of those who had been
caught, rose until they became all one
scream.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>But</span> Kirby had not left the safety
of the tree merely to get a ringside
view of carnage. He faced his
next, his final task unhesitatingly.
Straight out he leaped from the shadows
of the jungle into the clearing,
out into the presence of the beleagured,
screaming ape-men. Well enough
he knew that those creatures, despite
their frenzy, might sight him and fall
upon him at any second; well enough
he knew that a single flick of the white
coils all over the clearing could crush
him instantly. But the time to worry
about those hazards would be when
they beset him. With a yell as piercing
as any in the whole bedlam, Kirby
rushed forward.</p>
<p>High up in the moonlit vault of the
night, swaying between the two poles
which supported it, hung the white
cage which was Naida&rsquo;s prison. By
the time Kirby had sprinted fifty
yards, he knew that his yells had
reached Naida. For she staggered to
her knees and looked straight at him.
A second later, though, he realized that
the almost inevitable recognition of
him by ape-men had come to pass.</p>
<p>Eight or ten of the creatures, left
unmolested for a second by the Serpent,
halted in the mad run they were
making for the sheltering jungle, and
while one pointed with hairy arm, the
others let out shrieks. Kirby gritted
his teeth in something like despair.
Then he realized that the worst danger&mdash;Quetzalcoatl&rsquo;s
blurred coils&mdash;was not
threatening him so far. And he went
on, straight toward the ape-men.</p>
<p>He did not look where, how, or at
whom he struck. All he knew was that
his rifle blazed, and as he clubbed at
soft flesh with the butt, blood spurted,
and new screams filled the night. He
felt and half saw big, stinking bodies
going down, and clawed his way forward,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_419' name='page_419'></a>419</span>
around them, over them. Then
he felt no more bodies, and knew that
he was through. A little farther he
ran over the trampled earth, and
stopped and looked up.</p>
<p>The howls of the living, the shrieks
of the dying deafened him. Renewed
shots from the rifles in the tree, made
the Serpent lash about in a dazzling
white blur, smashing trees, apes, everything
in its path. But Kirby, finding
himself still safe, scarcely heard or
saw. His eyes, turned upward, saw
one thing only.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naida!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>She</span> had snapped two of the withes
of the cage and was leaning forward
through the opening. Her face
was livid with horror and exhaustion,
but she was able to look at him with
eyes that glowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you came!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;You
came to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a flash Kirby jumped over to the
poles and began to cast off one of the
lines which held the cage aloft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get ready for a bump!&rdquo; he shouted,
as he lowered away, arms straining.</p>
<p>Paying out the one line left the cage
suspended from the second, but let it
sweep from its position between the
poles, down toward one pole. As the
thing struck the tall support, Kirby
bounded over to stand beneath it, only
too sharply aware of the death waiting
for him on every side, but ignoring
it. Naida still hung suspended a
good twenty feet above him, but there
was no time to let go the other line.
He braced himself and held up his
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump!&rdquo; he yelled.</p>
<p>Then he saw the white gown sweeping
down toward him, felt the crash of
a soft body against his, and staggered
back. Recovered in a tenth of a second,
he drew a deep breath, and looked
at Naida beside him, tall and brave,
unhurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you able to run?&rdquo; he snapped,
and then, the moment she nodded, motioned
toward the jungle.</p>
<p>Behind them, in front, on all sides,
rose screams so horrible that he wondered
even then if he would ever forget.
As he started to run, he realized
that when Naida had finally landed in
his arms, the nearest squirming loop
of the Serpent had been no more than
four yards away, and that, right now,
if their luck failed, a single unfortunate
twist of the incredible hundreds
of feet of white muscle could still end
things for them.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>But</span> luck was not going to fail.
Somehow Kirby knew it as they
sprinted side by side, and the sheltering
jungle loomed closer every second.
And a moment later, something
beside his own inner faith made him
know it, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Naida! Look!&rdquo; he screeched
all at once.</p>
<p>At the upper end of the clearing,
where an unthinkable slaughter was
going on, there leaped out from
amongst a surging mass of apes, leaped
out from almost directly beneath a
downward smashing blur of white
snake folds, a figure which Kirby had
not seen or thought about for many
seconds.</p>
<p>The Duca&rsquo;s robe hung in tatters from
his body. Blood had smeared his white
hair. His eyes were those of a man
gone mad from fear. And as he escaped
the tons of muscle which so nearly had
engulfed him, he began to run even as
Kirby felt himself running.</p>
<p>Straight toward him and Naida,
Kirby saw the man spurt, but whether
the mad eyes recognized them or not,
he could not tell, nor did he care. All
at once his feeling that they would
escape the clearing, became conviction.</p>
<p>For suddenly the same single twitch
of Quetzalcoatl&rsquo;s vast folds which
might have finished them, if luck had
not held, put an end to the Duca&rsquo;s retreat.
At one moment the man&rsquo;s path
was clear. The next&mdash;</p>
<p>Kirby, running for dear life, gasped,
and heard Naida cry out beside him.</p>
<p>The great loops flashed, twisted, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_420' name='page_420'></a>420</span>
where had been an open way for the
Duca, loomed a wall of scaly white
flesh. The living wall twitched, closed
in; and as the Duca dodged and leaped
to no avail, a cry shrilled across the
night&mdash;a cry that cut like a knife.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Kirby</span> saw no more. But it was
likely that most, if not all, of the
caciques had gone with the Duca.</p>
<p>Somehow, anyhow, in but a few seconds
more, Kirby dove into the spot
from which he had left the jungle to
enter the clearing. As Naida pressed
against him, winded but still strong,
he found his best hopes for immediate
retreat realized, for Gori, Nini, and
Ivana, down from their tree, ran toward
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is all right,&rdquo; he said with a gesture
which cut short the outbursts
ready to come. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got to keep
going. Ivana, tell Gori that her people
are gone, wiped out, but that if she
will cast her lot with us, we will not
forget what she has done. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Gori leading them they ran,
stumbling, recovering themselves,
stumbling again. To breathe became
an agony. But not until many minutes
later, when they plowed into the cover
of a fern belt whose blackness not even
the moonlight had pierced, did Kirby
call a halt.</p>
<p>Here he swept a final glance behind
him, listened long for sounds of pursuit,
and relaxed a little only when
none came to disturb the night stillness.
However, that relaxation, now
that he permitted it at last, meant
something.</p>
<p>The complete silence gave him final
conviction that what he had said about
the whole ape-people being destroyed
was true. As for the Serpent&mdash;well,
perhaps he was destroyed even as they
were. Perhaps not. In any case the
grip which Quetzalcoatl held upon the
imagination of the People of the Temple
had been destroyed by this night&rsquo;s
work, and that was what counted most.
The Serpent would be worshipped no
longer.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Kirby</span> reached out in the darkness
and found Naida&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; he said to all of the
party. &ldquo;I think the past is&mdash;the past.
And with Gori to guide us out of the
jungle, and our own brains to guide
us through the jungle of self-government
after that, I think the future
ought to be bright enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ivana and Nini both chuckled as
they moved again, and Gori, hearing
her name spoken in a kindly voice,
twitched her ears appreciatively. Naida
drew very close to Kirby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo; she
asked presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;temple,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the crown which probably is
still lying on the altar there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirby looked up in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I had forgotten about that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what could I have been thinking
about except how you looked when
we came together in that gloomy place,
and walked forward, side by side?
<i>Now</i> have I told you enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naida laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is so much to be done!&rdquo;
Kirby exclaimed then. &ldquo;As soon as
possible, we must climb to the Valley
of the Geyser, go on into the outer
world, and there seek carefully for
men who are willing, and fit, to come
here. And that is only one task.
Others come crowding to me every second.
But first&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Naida asked softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The temple. Naida, we will reach
the plateau sometime to-morrow. All
of the girls who kept watch there will
be waiting for us, and it will be a time
of happiness. May we not, then, go to
the temple? There will be no priests.
But we will make our pledges without
them. Tell me, may I hope that it will
be so&mdash;to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naida did not answer at once. She
did not even nod. But presently her
shoulder, still fragrant with faint perfume,
brushed his. She clasped his
hand then, and as they walked on in
silence, Kirby knew.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;<i>Literature</i>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>After comparison with various other magazines
which specialize in the publication of
Science Fiction, we&mdash;The Scientific Fiction
Library Ass&rsquo;n, of 1457 First Ave., New York
City&mdash;have found that your magazine,
Amazing Stories, publishes stories to
which the term &ldquo;literature&rdquo; may be applied
in its real sense. A fine example of this is
the story &ldquo;Murder Madness,&rdquo; by Murray
Leinster. Others of the finer novels are:
&ldquo;The Beetle Horde,&rdquo; by Victor Rousseau,
and, up to the present installment, &ldquo;Earth,
the Marauder,&rdquo; by Arthur J. Burks. &ldquo;Brigands
of the Moon,&rdquo; by Ray Cummings, was
interesting and well-written, but it was not
literature (not a story which you will remember
and read over again). Of the shorter stories,
the novelettes, the best are: &ldquo;Spawn of
the Stars,&rdquo; by Charles W. Diffin, &ldquo;Monsters
of Moyen,&rdquo; by Arthur J. Burks, and &ldquo;The
Atom Smasher,&rdquo; by Victor Rousseau.</p>
<p>Since the magazine started, there are only
three stories that did not belong in the magazine,
and were not even interesting. These
are: &ldquo;The Corpse on the Grating,&rdquo; by Hugh
B. Cave; &ldquo;The Stolen Mind,&rdquo; by M. Staley,
and the last (I wonder that the editors who
used such good sense in picking the other
finer stories, let it pass), &ldquo;Vampires of Venus,&rdquo;
by Anthony Pelcher. May you keep
up the high standard of fiction you are publishing
at present.&mdash;Nathan Greenfeld, 873
Whitlock Ave., New York City.</p>
<h3><i>You See&mdash;It Didn&rsquo;t!</i></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Firstly, let me say that I am sending a
year&rsquo;s subscription to Astounding Stories,
which will tell you that they are good.</p>
<p>On the average, the stories are of good
literary merit and plot. However, there is
one thing that seems to be getting rather
pushed into the background and that is the
second part of your title, &ldquo;Super-Science.&rdquo;
If this is to be a Science Fiction magazine
let us have it so. I am kicking against stories
like &ldquo;Murder Madness&rdquo; and the like. They
are really excellent in every way but just
need that tincture of a little scientific background
to make them super-excellent. &ldquo;Brigands
of the Moon&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Moon Master&rdquo;
seem to me more the type of story &ldquo;our
mag&rdquo; should publish, from its name.</p>
<p>No doubt this criticism will leave you cold
and this effusion find its way into the nearest
waste paper basket, but I find that a number
of your readers in Australia think somewhat
the same as I do.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_422' name='page_422'></a>422</span></div>
<p>More brickbats&mdash;I hope not! and more
bouquets&mdash;I hope so! the next time I write.&mdash;N.W.
Alcock, 5 Gaza Rd., Naremburn, N.S.W.,
Australia.</p>
<h3><i>Not in de Head!!</i></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I shall be glad to take advantage of your
cordial invitation to come over to &ldquo;The
Readers&rsquo; Corner.&rdquo; In the first place, I find
your magazine the best of its kind on the
market, and you are to be congratulated on
having such excellent authors as Ray Cummings,
Murray Leinster and Captain S. P.
Meek. Nevertheless, there are so many
things to be criticized that I hardly know
where to begin.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start of with stories of future warfare.
Although this class is potentially one
of the most interesting, it is at the same time
one of the most abused. Ray Cummings can
write classics in this field, but the efforts of
most the others are atrocities. I&rsquo;ll wager
that their favorite childhood sport was mowing
down whole regiments of lead soldiers
with oxy-acetylene torches. It shows in their
writings. Why can&rsquo;t they think of something
original? Why can&rsquo;t they make their stories
logical? The merits of a story are not dependent
on the number of people wiped out
by one blast of a death ray! But they all
stick to the same old plot. A merciless but
well-meaning scientist, or hordes from a
foreign planet, wipe out thousands of American
citizens at one blow. Hundreds of airplanes
are disintegrated before they discover
that the enemy is invulnerable. An ultimatum
in domineering tones gives the terror-stricken
populace forty-eight hours in which to surrender.
But, all unknown to the dastardly
villains, an obscure young scientist labors to
save his country and the girl he loves. Fifteen
minutes before the time set in the ultimatum
he perfects a new weapon that soon
sends the invaders to their well merited fate.</p>
<p>Surely you realize how ridiculous the whole
affair is. It is only slightly less nauseating
than the plot used in the stories of advanced
civilizations where the hero is conducted on
a sight-seeing tour by the individual in whose
path he popped upon entering this new world.
I can&rsquo;t believe that more than a handful of
my fellow beings are of such low intelligence
that they can find enjoyment in such trash.
You will notice that although every reader
has a different list of favorite authors, Ray
Cummings has his name in practically every
list. He is easily your favorite author. Ray
Cummings does not wipe out whole cities at
one time. His heroes do not save the world
by inventing a new weapon at a moment&rsquo;s
notice. His wars are not of forty-eight hours&rsquo;
duration. His conquerors do not attempt to
win the war by one great attack on New
York City. Do try to have your authors
write logical stories.</p>
<p>I would now like to criticize the love element
in your stories. I do not claim that
there should be none whatever from cover to
cover of your magazine, but I do claim that
there should be none unless it really helps
the plot. Most of your authors seem to think
that a girl is necessary in every plot and so
they bring her in, disregarding the fact that
they do not know how to handle such material.
The way it stands now, the heroine is
introduced in a lame, routine fashion; is
rescued once or twice; and accepts the hero
as a husband in an altogether lame fashion.</p>
<p>There are many other points but they can
wait. Logical war stories, no Utopias or
sight-seeing tours, sensible love element, plus
your present policy will make a corking
magazine.&mdash;Philip Waite, 3400 Wayne Ave.,
New York, N.Y.</p>
<h3><i>No Present Plans</i></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Thanks for the new color cover. It certainly
is a big improvement. The picture on
the front of &ldquo;our&rdquo; magazine was just as
astounding as the story by R. F. Starzl from
which it was drawn. Let&rsquo;s have more stories
from the pen of Mr. Starzl.</p>
<p>In my opinion &ldquo;Beyond the Heaviside
Layer&rdquo; is the best story I have read in
Astounding Stories to date. I am very
pleased that you intend to print a sequel to
it.</p>
<p>Now I would like to ask you a question.
Do you intend to print an Annual or Quarterly,
or do think you will ever enlarge the
size of this magazine? I don&rsquo;t care so much
whether you enlarge the magazine or not, but
I certainly would like to read an Annual or
Quarterly.</p>
<p>Even though this letter meets the fate of
thousands of other such letters and sees the
inside of your wastebasket, I will at least
have had the pleasure of writing to you and
wishing &ldquo;our&rdquo; magazine success to the nth
degree.&mdash;Forrest J. Ackerman,
236½
N. New
Hampshire, Los Angeles, Calif.</p>
<h3><i>&ldquo;Excellent&rdquo; to &ldquo;So-So&rdquo;</i></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I notice a large number of subscribers are
giving their opinions of Astounding Stories.
I hate to be with the crowd, but I have to
side with the majority in this case and say
it&rsquo;s just about right.</p>
<p>My favorite writers are R. F. Starzl (that
&ldquo;Planet of Dread&rdquo; was a peach). Chas. W.
Diffin, A. Merritt, Ralph Milne Farley, Murray
Leinster and Ray Cummings.</p>
<p>Now as to the August issue, here is how I
rate them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Planet of Dread&rdquo;&mdash;more than 20c. worth
at the first crack. A real story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord of Space&rdquo;&mdash;excellent. I meant to
include Victor Rousseau in my list of favorites
above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Second Satellite&rdquo;&mdash;so-so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver Dome&rdquo;&mdash;so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Earth the Marauder&rdquo;&mdash;too deep for me.
And that Beryl stuff is sheer bunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder Madness&rdquo;&mdash;a real story. Get more
like this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Flying City&rdquo;&mdash;too much explanation
and description and not enough action.</p>
<p>Perhaps it looks like I&rsquo;m sort of critical
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_423' name='page_423'></a>423</span>
after all, but I didn&rsquo;t mean it just that way.
What I&rsquo;m driving at is that Astounding
Stories is by far superior to its competitors,
and I&rsquo;m telling you so because it might make
you feel better to know it. If you want to
print this testimonial, go to it. To tell the
truth, I&rsquo;ll be looking for it.&mdash;Leslie P. Mann,
1227 Ogden Ave., Chicago, Illinois.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<i>Too Many Serials</i>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I have just finished the August issue, and
I would like to tell you my opinion of it and
the magazine as a whole.</p>
<p>The stories in order of merit were:</p>
<p>1&mdash;&ldquo;The Second Satellite&rdquo;; 2&mdash;&ldquo;The Flying
City&rdquo;; 3&mdash;&ldquo;Silver Dome&rdquo;; 4&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord of
Space&rdquo;; 5&mdash;&ldquo;The Planet of Dread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t pass judgment upon the serials, as
I have not read all the parts.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;The Flying City&rdquo; there are a number
of points I am hazy about. How could Cor
speak English? However, this could be
cleared up by saying that Cor sent out men
to get the language, etc.</p>
<p>As a whole, Astounding Stories is a good
magazine. There are too many serials, however,
but since other readers like them I
won&rsquo;t complain.</p>
<p>You have a fine array of Science Fiction
authors. With such writers as Vincent, Meek,
Hamilton, Starzl and Ernst, your magazine
can&rsquo;t be anything but a success.</p>
<p>The September layouts look good to me.
I hope it is.&mdash;E. Anderson, 1765 Southern
Blvd., New York, N.Y.</p>
<h3><i>Thanks, Mr. Glasser</i></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Somewhat belatedly I am writing to commend
you most heartily on the August issue
of Astounding Stories, which I consider by
far the finest number since the inception of
the magazine last January. The authors
whose work appeared in this issue are among
the greatest modern writers of fantasy and
scientific fiction. Leinster, Burks, Hamilton,
Rousseau&mdash;what a brilliant galaxy! And
Starzl, Vincent, Rich; all writers of note. If
ever a magazine merited the designation &ldquo;all-star
number,&rdquo; your August issue filled the
bill.</p>
<p>However, I am confident that even this
superb achievement will be surpassed by
some future edition of Astounding Stories,
for each succeeding number to date has improved
on the one before. And with a new
Cummings novel in the offing, it seems the
August issue, despite its excellence, will
speedily be eclipsed.&mdash;Allen Glasser, 1510
University Ave., New York, N.Y.</p>
<h3><i>Are Our Covers Too &ldquo;Gaudy&rdquo;?</i></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>This is the first time that I have ventured
to air my views to any magazine, but as yours
interests me greatly I hereby shed my reticence.</p>
<p>I believe, of all magazine of your type, you
have come nearest perfection. But there are
just a few things that bother me, and, no
doubt, others like me. In the first place, must
you make your covers as lurid and as contradictory
to good design as they are?
Really, I blush when my newsdealer hands
me the gaudy thing. People interested in
science do not usually succumb to circus
poster advertising.</p>
<p>Then there are the stories. I realize that
you must cater to all tastes, but some of
them are very childish, slightly camouflaged
fairy tales. Science Fiction can be written
very convincingly, as is testified by the stories
of H. G. Wells, Ray Cummings, Jules Verne,
and others. These writers attain their effects
by the proper use of the English language,
without silly and obviously tacked-on romance,
the use of known scientific facts elaborated
sensibly and by not trying to make a
novel out of a short story.</p>
<p>The stimulation of the imagination from
Science Fiction is most enjoyable and I shall
continue to read your magazine even though
my fault finding is not considered, for, as I
said before, you certainly have come nearer
my ideal than any of the others.&mdash;Hector D.
Spear, 867 W. 181st St., The Tri-Sigma
Fraternity, New York City.</p>
<h3><i>Nossir&mdash;Our Astronomy Is O. K.</i></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am taking advantage of your invitation to
write to you. Since Astounding Stories is
available you have given me a lot of pleasure,
and I hope you may get a little pleasure out
of reading this.</p>
<p>First, I want to say that you&rsquo;re hitting the
ball as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. I could hardly
suggest an improvement.</p>
<p>In the August issue I liked &ldquo;Planet of
Dread,&rdquo; by R. F. Starzl, best. When that
thing in the &ldquo;pipe&rdquo; grabbed me, I mean
Gunga, wow! And it gave me a lot of satisfaction
to see the Master in &ldquo;Murder Madness,&rdquo;
by Murray Leinster, get it in the neck.
&ldquo;Lord of Space&rdquo; was good, too. In fact all
the stories were good. I have only read two
or three I really did not like since you started.</p>
<p>Say, I never heard of a planet named Inra.
Don&rsquo;t you think your author ought to brush
up on his astronomy? I also noticed some
other authors are a little weak on astronomy;
not that I&rsquo;m complaining. The stories are
O. K. with me.&mdash;Harry Johnson, 237 E. 128th
St., New York City.</p>
<h3><i>Mr. Yetter Checks Up on Us</i></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>As I am a constant reader of Astounding
Stories I wish to say that though S. P. Meek
is one of my favorite authors his story, &ldquo;Cold
Light,&rdquo; was a little wrong when he called the
&ldquo;Silver Range&rdquo; by the name of &ldquo;Stillwater
Range.&rdquo; I also think it would have been better
if he had had a car take Dr. Bird and
Carnes out to the hills, became even in Fallon
a burro is a strange sight.</p>
<p>But Meek, Cummings, Burks and all the
rest of our famous authors&rsquo; stories should be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_424' name='page_424'></a>424</span>
in the magazine often. If Verrill, Wells,
Nathenson and Hamilton would also write,
the magazine would be perfect.</p>
<p>I like all the stories, though some seem to
be copies, and others lack science.</p>
<p>Here is for a long life for Astounding
Stories!&mdash;Frank Yetter, 369 Railroad Ave.,
Fallon, Nevada.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<i>Charm All Its Own</i>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Let me congratulate you. I have just read
&ldquo;The Planet of Dread,&rdquo; by R. F. Starzl, in
your August issue of Astounding Stories.</p>
<p>Real science, you know, is pretty rigidly
limited, but super-science of the kind you
seem to run has a freshness and charm all
its own.</p>
<p>I came upon your magazine quite by accident,
and from now on no doubt will look
for it as I stand before the racks of magazines,
trying to decide upon something to
read&mdash;Anton J. Sartori, 1330 W. 6th St., Los
Angeles, Calif.</p>
<h3><i>Inra <em>Could</em> Exist</i></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>You will have to excuse this old telegraph
office typewriter. It is all I have to express
my appreciation to you for the tremendously
interesting magazine you put out. I have
only read the last three issues, but those are
enough to convince me that Astounding Stories
fills a long-felt want. I read all the
others too, but from now on I&rsquo;m going to
look over their offerings at the stand before
I buy. They have to go some to come up
to the standard set by you, especially in the
August copy.</p>
<p>That story, &ldquo;The Planet of Dread,&rdquo; was the
most weird, exciting, thrilling, satisfying&mdash;in
short, the most &ldquo;astounding&rdquo; story I have
ever read. Nothing has seemed so real since
I first read Wells&rsquo; stories. I liked the characters.
Poor Gunga. I could just see him,
trying to sacrifice the man he obviously worshipped
to stop that horrible noise. The picture
of Gunga on the cover was just exactly
what I would expect the Martian to look
like. You have a good artist. I liked Mark
Forepaugh, too. He didn&rsquo;t lose his nerve for
one minute&mdash;not Mark. Who says civilization
is going down, when the future holds men
like that?</p>
<p>Next to &ldquo;The Planet of Dread&rdquo; I liked
&ldquo;The Lord of Space.&rdquo; That was a vivid and
well-drawn story, too. Those two, I think,
were the outstanding stories for August. But
I must not forget &ldquo;Murder Madness,&rdquo; the
serial; it was thrilling and convincing. That&rsquo;s
the only kick I have: so many stories sound
thin. I don&rsquo;t believe them when I read them.
I also want to mention &ldquo;The Forgotten
Planet&rdquo; and &ldquo;From An Amber Block.&rdquo; Good,
exciting, and you can believe them without
too much strain.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, the author of &ldquo;The Planet
of Dread&rdquo; made a mistake when he chose
a mythical planet for his terrific adventures.
Why not Venus or Mercury? If they have
water the conditions on them would be similar
to what he described for Inra. There
ain&rsquo;t no such planet. But why expect
perfection! I&rsquo;m satisfied.</p>
<p>I wish you success. That&rsquo;s a late wish.
You&rsquo;re a success already.&mdash;Tom P. Fitzgerald,
Newcastle, Nebraska.</p>
<h3><i>Thus Ended the Quest</i></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>This is my first letter to your magazine,
and right away I&rsquo;m asking for a pair of
sequels. One of these is to &ldquo;The Moon Master,&rdquo;
by Charles W. Diffin. These sad endings
depress me greatly, but if I looked at
the ending first to see whether or not it was
sad it would ruin the story; and besides sad
endings usually have good stories in front of
them. The other sequel I want is to &ldquo;From
The Ocean&rsquo;s Depths,&rdquo; by Sewell P. Wright,
and its sequel &ldquo;Into The Ocean&rsquo;s Depths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In looking over my back copies of the magazine
I find that I have not disliked a single
story. Thus endeth my quest for a brickbat.</p>
<p>Are you going to put out a quarterly?
Both the other Science Fiction magazines
that I get do so, and I observe that it gives
opportunity for a story of full novel length
all in one piece. Not that I object to serials,
but I like once in a while to sit down to a
long story without having to dig out three
or four magazines. However, please continue
the long serials, for what is life without the
element of suspense?&mdash;Hugh M. Gilmore, 920
N. Vista St., Hollywood, Cal.</p>
